"As the maid arrived early in the morning – despite her usual speed and energy, which she had been asked not to do so often, she slapped the doors so hard that it was impossible to have a peaceful sleep anywhere in the entire apartment from the moment she arrived –, she found nothing out of the ordinary during her usual short visit to Gregor. She thought he was deliberately lying there motionless and playing the injured party; she trusted him to understand everything. Since she happened to be holding the long broom, she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When that didn't produce any results, she became annoyed and pushed a little into Gregor, and only when she had moved him without any resistance from his usual spot did she take notice. As she soon realized the true state of affairs, she opened her eyes wide, whistled softly to herself, but didn't linger, and instead threw open the bedroom door and shouted loudly into the darkness: ""Just look at that! It's turned into a monster; there it is, completely, utterly a monster!"""
"As the place of sighing and wailing falls silent, the two bodies lie outstretched in the darkness side by side. It will never be like today again, thinks Hans. This is how it will be from now on, thinks Katharina. Then sleep wipes out all thoughts, and what has happened to them will be written onto their brain surface as they lie quietly together, breathing calmly.  "
"She also has a trunk with letters, carbons of letters, and mementos, mostly flatware, as one says in the language of archives. She has her diaries and calendars. The next day, she climbs up the bookshelf and retrieves the trunk from the top compartment, dusty inside and out. A long time ago, the papers from the boxes and the ones from her trunk had a dialogue with each other. Now they are having a dialogue with time. In such a trunk, in such a box, it doesn't matter whether it's the end, the beginning, or the middle, all lies together in the dust of the decades, lies what was written to deceive and what was thought to be true, what was kept secret and what was described, lies all that, whether it wants to or not, folded tightly together, lies the contradictory, lies the silenced anger just as much as the silenced love together in an envelope, in the same folder, forgotten things are just as withered and creased as what one still remembers, dimly or brightly. While Katharina's hands are getting dusty as she goes through the old folders, she must think about how her father always appeared as a magician at her children's birthdays. He had thrown a whole stack of playing cards into the air and then pulled out the one that she or one of the other children had previously remembered."
"The sky darkened above the opera café, and a thunderstorm broke out near the Crown Prince's Palace, a rain shower sweeping passengers away as the bus stopped at Marx-Engels Square and the doors opened. Several people rushed in to seek shelter from the rain. And so, the person who was initially standing at the entrance was pushed to the middle."
"From this dream, the Heimgesuchte woke up, worn out, shattered, and completely under the demon's control. He no longer feared the observing gazes of people; whether he risked being suspected by them or not, he didn't care. After all, they were fleeing, traveling away; many beach huts stood empty, the occupancy of the dining hall showed larger gaps, and in the city, it was rare to see a stranger. The truth had seeped in, and despite the persistent unity of the interested parties, panic was no longer possible to conceal. But the woman in the pearl jewelry remained with hers, whether the rumors didn't reach her or because she was too proud and fearless to leave them; Tadzio stayed; and to him, in his limited scope, it was sometimes as if flight and death could remove all disturbing life in the circle and leave him alone with the beautiful on this island. - yes, when, in the morning, his gaze, heavy, unaccountable, unattached, rested on the coveted object, when, with the sinking day, he followed unworthily through alleys where concealed, secretly, death was spreading, he seemed to find it promising and futile the law of morals."
"The sky was grey, the wind was damp; the harbors and islands were left behind, and everything on the misty horizon disappeared quickly. Clods of coal dust fell, swollen with moisture, onto the deck that wouldn't dry. After an hour, they set up a sail cover, as it started raining."
"The sister rushed to the mother and held out her forehead. The father seemed to be brought to more specific thoughts by the sister's words, had straightened up, was playing with his servant's cap between the dishes that were still on the table from the night's meal of the boarders, and occasionally looked at the quiet Gregor."
"The doors closed again, the bus drove off, she searched for a handhold.        And then she saw him.        And he saw her.        Outside, a real flood descended, inside it steamed from the wet clothing of those who had boarded.        Now the bus stopped at Alex. The stop, however, was under the S-Bahn bridge."
"Hermine, whom I saw for the second time today, knew everything about me, it seemed impossible for me to have a secret from her. It might be that she didn't quite understand my spiritual life; she may not have been able to follow me in my connections to music, Goethe, Novalis, or Baudelaire - but even that was questionable; she would probably not be bothered. And even if - what was left of my ""spiritual life"" anyway? Didn't it all lie in pieces and have lost its meaning? But my other, my most personal problems and concerns, I was sure she would understand. Soon I would be talking with her about the Steppenwolf, about the treatise, about everything and everything that had only existed for me up until now, something I had never spoken a word about to anyone. I couldn't resist starting immediately."
"It had been about a month since Gregor's transformation, and it was no longer a cause for surprise for the sister to see him in his new state. She arrived a little earlier than usual and found Gregor still standing by the window, motionless and quite terrifyingly still, staring out the window. It wouldn't have been unexpected for Gregor if she hadn't entered, as he was blocking the way to the window, but she not only didn't enter, she even took a step back and closed the door. A stranger would have thought that Gregor was lying in wait and wanted to bite her. Gregor hid himself immediately under the sofa, but he had to wait until lunchtime for his sister to return, and she seemed much more agitated than usual. He realized that her glimpse of him was still unbearable and would remain so, and that she must have had to force herself to confront even a glimpse of his small, protruding body parts. To spare her this sight, he, on one occasion, took four hours to spread a bed sheet on the sofa and arranged it in such a way that he was completely covered, so that even if she bent down, she couldn't see him. If the sheet wasn't necessary in her opinion, she could have removed it, as it was clear that it couldn't be to Gregor's pleasure to be completely sealed off, but she left the sheet as it was, and Gregor even thought he caught a grateful glance from her when he cautiously lifted the sheet a little to see how she was taking to the new arrangement."
"He pours her a glass of white wine with trout and notices in passing that she knows how to fillet a fish. She sees his spectacle case on the table, along with his packet of cigarettes, marked Duett, and thinks that she'll never want to sit at a table again where his spectacle case and cigarettes aren't lying."
"Weary, numbed by the turmoil of this strange morning, he allowed himself to collapse onto a rocking chair by the open window after he had scattered the contents of his briefcase in the room. The sea had taken on a pale green hue, the air seemed thinner and purer, the beach with its huts and boats more colorful, although the sky was still gray. Aschenbach gazed out, his hands clasped in his lap, content to be back, shaking his head in dissatisfaction at his own vacillation and ignorance of his own desires. He sat there for about an hour, resting and dreamily lost in thought. Around noon, he spotted Tadzio, who was returning to the hotel from the sea, walking along the beach fence and wooden paths in a striped linen suit with a red stripe, and Aschenbach immediately recognized him from his height before he could actually look directly at him, and was about to think, ""Ah, there you are again, Tadzio!"" But in the same instant, he felt how the casual greeting gave way to the truth of his heart, and he felt the exhilaration of his blood, the joy, the pain of his soul, and realized that the separation from Tadzio had become all the more difficult because of him."
"It's nice to walk alongside him, she thinks.   It's nice to walk alongside her, he thinks.        Twenty-minute walk through the night. He knows the local well, he's been there many times, the waiter gives him, as usual, the table reserved for regular customers."
"It was a song that no solitary person had ever forgotten, a brazen pop song in an incomprehensible dialect, equipped with a laughing refrain in which the band regularly broke into it with full throat. The words and instrumental accompaniment stopped there, and nothing was left but a rhythmically organized but naturally handled laughter that the soloist with great talent knew how to shape with breathtaking liveliness. He had regained his entire boldness once he had restored his artistic distance from the ladies and gentlemen, and his artistic laughter, shamelessly sent forth from the balcony, was like a howling laughter. Already towards the end of the articulated part of the verse, it seemed as if he was struggling with an irresistible tickling. He sobbed, his voice trembled, he pressed his hand to his mouth, he twisted his shoulders, and at the given moment, the uncontrollable laughter burst forth from him, with such truth that it had an infectious effect and shared with the listeners that even on the balcony, a carefree and self-contained merriment was spreading. But this only seemed to double the singer's abandon. He bent his knees, he slapped his thighs, he held his sides, he wanted to burst, he no longer laughed, he screamed; he pointed with his finger, as if there was nothing funnier than the laughing company up there, and finally, everyone in the garden and on the veranda, even to the waiters, lift boys, and housekeepers in the doors, laughed."
"It's five o'clock, 10:00 AM Berlin time, and she gets up punctually for the start of the ceremony, places a candle on the hotel room table, lights it, and plays music from the internet.        She plays the second movement of Mozart's D minor Concerto.   She plays the aria from Bach's Goldberg Variations.   She plays Chopin's Mazurka in A minor.   Each of these musical pieces has interruptions where advertisements are shown.   The new Hyundai. A bank that grants home loans. A medication for a cold.        Six weeks later, when she returns to Berlin from Pittsburgh, she sees the fresh sandhill and the birch tree next to it. The roses she had her friend place on the grave are already gone. The friend tells her about the funeral. Music was played.   What kind?, she asks.   Mozart, Bach, and Chopin, says the friend.   She nods.        Half a year later, her husband is at home when a woman delivers two large boxes.   She's been crying, he says, I gave her a tissue.   The boxes remain at Katharina's office until late into the fall."
"At Ganymed on Schiffbauerdamm, his wife told him that she's pregnant. Ganymed has celebrated the first printed manuscript with his editor. Now he's standing outside the pub and waiting for a 19-year-old girl.        The 19-year-old girl knew his eyes, his nose, his shoulders all day yesterday and today. But how he looks in general, she may not remember anymore. Impatiently, she's going back over her memories."
"Returned to the hotel, he immediately went to the lobby to the newspaper stand and scanned the pages. He found nothing in the foreign papers. The domestic ones reported rumors, showed uncertain numbers, repeated official denials, and doubted their veracity. Thus, the withdrawal of the German and Austrian element was explained. The members of the other nations seemed to know nothing, suspected nothing, and were not yet disturbed.        ""Man shall be silent!"" thought Aschenbach excitedly, tossing the journals back onto the table. ""Man shall keep quiet!"" But at the same time, his heart filled with satisfaction over the adventure the outside world wanted to embark upon. For passion, like crime, is not in accordance with the secure order and well-being of everyday life, and every loosening of the civil framework, every confusion and turmoil of the world must be welcome, as it can hope to find its advantage in it without limit. So Aschenbach felt a dark contentment over the official shrouded events in Venice's dirty alleys - this terrible secret of the city, which had merged with his own secret, and whose preservation was so important to him. For the lover was only concerned that Tadzio would leave, and he did not recognize without horror that he would not know how to live anymore if that happened."
"Kairos, the god of happy moments, they say, has a single lock on his forehead, and that's where you can hold onto him. But once the god has passed by on his winged feet, he presents you with the bald, blank back of the skull, and there's nothing to grasp onto. Was that a happy moment when she met Hans as a nineteen-year-old girl? On a day at the beginning of November, she sits on the floor and begins to go through the contents of the first box, then the second, page by page, folder by folder. Essentially, it's a field of ruins. The oldest notes date back to 86, the latest to 92. She finds letters and photocopies of letters, notes, shopping lists, calendars, photos, negatives of photos, postcards, collages, and here and there an article from the newspaper. A piece of sugar from Café Kranzler crumbles in her hands. Pressed leaves fall out between pages, passport photos are stuck to pages with office clips, and in a matchbox, a tuft of hair is stored."
"Silently, he commiserated with the mishap, finding it extremely embarrassing for him and the Institute, but assented with conviction to Aschenbach's decision to wait for the luggage here. Although his room was taken, another, not inferior, was immediately available. 'No chance, sir', said the smiling Swiss elevator operator as one ascended. And so the fugitive was accommodated once more, in a room that almost identical in layout and furnishings to the previous one."
"He carefully chose a larger table, we will be a trio, he told the waiter. And now, she's already in on it, they glance occasionally at the absent third person. For the appetizer, he explained, one must absolutely take the Berner Butterbouillon here, because it contains an egg-leek. They therefore spoon their Berner Butterbouillon, each lifting the egg-leek onto their spoon and marveling at the wonder. An egg-leek, he says, with emphasis on the last syllable, and looks at her expectantly, whether she understands the joke. She returns his gaze. Thus the first word is uttered in their shared vocabulary. And he brought a book with him, so she knows what he writes. His first gift to her. The dedication is meant for her to read later. Then again, they glance at the door and shake their heads - where is the tardy guy only? They are in accord with each other, they have their first secrets from the world, they know what only they recall when they look at each other. Precisely because of this, he needs to clarify the conditions before it's too late.     "
"After a few years of unrest, after several stays here and there, he had chosen Munich as his permanent residence at an early stage and lived there in a bourgeois manner, as one can occasionally find oneself, driven by the spirit of individual cases. The marriage, which he entered into at a young age with a girl from a scholarly family, was separated by death after a short period of happiness. He was left with a daughter, already a wife, and he had never had a son."
"Recently, he was not content to simply thank the beauty of the day's routine and happiness; he pursued him, he followed him. For example, the Poles never appeared at the beach on Sundays; he guessed that they were attending Mass at St. Mark's, so he hastened there, and entering the glitzy place, absorbed by the golden twilight of the sanctuary, he found the beloved one, bent over a prayer bench during the service. Then he stood in the background, on the cracked mosaic floor, amidst the people on their knees, murmuring, and crossing themselves, and the opulent grandeur of the oriental temple weighed heavily on his senses. In front, the heavily adorned priest was walking, conducting, and singing, incense wafted up, enveloping the feeble flames of the altar candles, and in the heavy, sweet offering scent, another seemed to mix in quietly: the smell of the ailing city. But through the haze and fog, Aschenbach saw how the Beautiful One there in front turned his head, looked for him, and then spotted him."
"He often lay there for the whole long nights, didn't sleep a wink, and only scratched on the leather for hours on end. Or he wouldn't shy away from the great effort of pushing a chair to the window, then climbing up onto the windowsill, and, leaning back in the chair, leaning against the window, apparently only in some memory of the liberating experience he once had, gazing out the window. For indeed, he saw the things, even the slightly distant ones, becoming less and less clear every day; the hospital opposite, which he had so often cursed, was no longer visible to him at all, and if he hadn't known exactly that he lived in the quiet but completely urban Charlottenstraße, he might have thought he was looking out of his window into a wasteland where the grey sky and grey earth merged indistinguishably. The attentive nurse had seen the chair by the window only twice, when she had put it back to its exact position after tidying up the room, and even from then on left the inner windowpane open."
"He had already reached the point where he could barely maintain his balance when the rocking chair was stronger, and soon he would have to make a final decision, as it was a quarter past eight - when the doorbell rang. ""That's someone from the office,"" he thought to himself and almost froze, while his little legs danced more eagerly. There was a moment of silence. ""Don't open,"" Gregor said to himself, entranced by some absurd hope. But then, as always, the maid went to the door and opened it with steady steps. Gregor only needed to hear the visitor's first words to know who it was - the head of accounts himself. Why was Gregor doomed to work for a company where any slight delay was immediately met with the greatest suspicion? Were all employees, without exception, scoundrels? Was there not one loyal and devoted person among them, who, even if they only wasted a few morning hours for the company, became simply unable to leave their bed due to pangs of conscience? Was it really not enough to ask a young apprentice if necessary, if it was even necessary, for the head of accounts to come and show the whole innocent family that only the head of accounts' understanding could be trusted with the investigation of this suspicious matter? And more due to the agitation in which Gregor was thrown by these thoughts than due to a rational decision, he heaved himself out of bed with all his might. There was a loud thud, but it was not a real crash. The fall was somewhat softened by the carpet, and Gregor's back was more elastic than he had thought, so the rather dull sound did not seem too noticeable. Only his head had not been held carefully enough and had hit; he turned it and rubbed it on the carpet in anger and pain."
"She knows that one lays the napkin over one's knees before eating, she knows that one wipes one's mouth before drinking, she knows that one pushes the soup spoon to the back and not towards oneself, that one does not rest one's elbows and does not cut potatoes with a knife. Against all fear, all hope, everything that one cannot and does not want to see beforehand, this helps, that one knows: one should lay the fork and knife together side by side when finished eating, with the handle on the right side of the plate. In the face of this man, who sits opposite her at this dinner as a huge stroke of luck, as a misfortune, and as a question, she understands: Now life has begun, and everything else was just preparation for it.     He thinks that she still looks beautiful even while chewing."
"Such useless thoughts that had no purpose in his current state went through his mind as he stood leaning against the door and listened. Sometimes he couldn't concentrate anymore due to general fatigue and let his head lazily lean against the door, but he immediately held it back, as even the small noise he made had been heard next door and had caused everyone to fall silent. ""What is he doing again?"", his father said after a while, apparently turned towards the door, and it was only then that the interrupted conversation gradually resumed."
"Tadzio, with three or four playmates who had remained with him, moved to the right in front of the others' hut, and, with a blanket over his knees, sitting about halfway between the sea and the row of beach huts, Aschenbach caught a final glance at him. The game, unattended since the women were busy with travel preparations, seemed chaotic and got out of hand. The sturdy one, in a leather jacket and with black, pomaded hair, who was nicknamed ""Jaschu,"" got into a sand fight and sparked Tadzio's temper, forcing him into a wrestling match that ended quickly with the defeat of the weaker boy. But as if in the hour of parting, the sense of subservience that had been serving the vanquished was transformed into cruel ferocity and sought revenge for a long slavery, the winner did not release his opponent even after victory, but instead pressed his face into the sand, as Tadzio, exhausted from the fight, was about to suffocate. His attempts to shake off the weight were convulsive, and he even stopped moving completely, only twitching now and then. Aschenbach, horrified, was about to spring to the rescue when the violent one finally released his victim. Tadzio, very pale, half-raised himself up and sat, supported by one arm, motionless for several minutes, with disheveled hair and darkening eyes. Then he stood up completely and walked slowly away. He was called, initially cheerfully, then anxiously and imploringly; he did not respond. The black one, who might have felt remorse for his outburst, caught up with him and tried to make amends. A shoulder movement sent him away. Tadzio walked diagonally down to the water. He was barefoot and wore his striped linen suit with a red ribbon."
"And now he plays for her the Impromptu in A minor by Franz Schubert, and the Chromatic Fantasy, the Partita in E minor, and the third movement of Mozart's B-flat major piano concerto. Sometimes he nods his head in rhythm, sometimes he says, ""That's great, isn't it?"" Sometimes she says, ""That's wonderfully beautiful."" Sometimes she asks, ""Who's playing?"" And he says, ""Arthur Rubinstein, Glenn Gould, Clara Haskil."" Between Bach and Mozart, she got up and went to the bathroom and saw the corduroy pants of her son hanging on the line. And in front of the mirror stood the little bottle of perfume, which gives the apartment its pleasant scent, Chanel No. 5. And three toothbrushes in a glass. And on a stool, the wife's nightgown, carelessly thrown aside in the midst of everyday life. Come, dear May, and make the trees green again, wishes the piano at the very end, but it's already July, and outside has turned into a summer night from the summer evening, and the red wine bottle is empty. Are you hungry? Yes. Then let's go eat. Yes."
"And now?        Without either of them needing to lose a word, they lead their steps homeward. Homeward now also means back to their own house.        From below, they look up to the still brightly lit windows."
"And so, she couldn't be persuaded by her mother to change her mind, who seemed uneasy and unsure in this room filled with anxiety, and soon grew quiet and helped her sister as much as she could with carrying the chest out of the room. Well, Gregor could temporarily do without the chest, but the desk had to remain. And as soon as the women had left the room with the chest, which they were struggling to carry, Gregor poked his head out from under the sofa to see how he could intervene carefully and as considerately as possible. But unfortunately, it was just the mother who returned first, while Grete held the chest in the adjacent room and swung it back and forth, without moving it from its spot, of course. But the mother wasn't used to Gregor's appearance and it could have made her ill, and so Gregor hurried back in alarm until he reached the other end of the sofa, but he couldn't prevent the sheet at the front from moving slightly. That was enough to catch the mother's attention. She stopped, stood still for a moment, and then went back to Grete."
"And even if Gregor had probably lost all mobility due to his wound and needed to take a long, long time to traverse his room like an old invalid - crawling was out of the question - he found a completely satisfactory replacement for this deterioration in his condition by the fact that the living room door, which he had been observing sharply for one or two hours beforehand, was always opened in the evening. So, lying in the darkness of his room, he could, unseen from the living room, watch the entire family at the lit table and listen to their conversations, as it were, with general permission, quite differently than before."
"Our star, he says, must not enter the Earth's atmosphere, then it will burn up immediately. The star is thus still stuck in the sky, pinned to the firmament with a safety pin, like the photos on its bookshelf, she thinks relieved. She nods. She says yes. He knows he's making it hard for her to say yes. Eternal sacrifices, that's the song that comes to mind. Who is worthy of sacrifice is chosen."
"Perhaps he has only gone out with her to be able to come back. To have the illusion that for her, too, the ordinary would be what is so familiar to him. It's completely natural for her to go into the living room ahead of him, while he goes to get a second bottle of wine from the kitchen. When he enters the room, she is standing by the window. The window sill is so low that it wouldn't be difficult to jump out, she thinks. Over there, she says, someone is still awake. That's a good friend of ours, he says, who paints. She probably hears that he said ""of ours"". He thinks she should know what's going on. She turns to him. He's holding a record in his hand, and his cigarette is hanging crookedly between his lips. Take that pipe out of your mouth, you dog. Here's the Requiem. That won't fit now, she says. Now, she said. The dead who lie in the earth don't sleep, but wait. Good music always fits, he says, and puts down the cigarette. Then, she says. He removes the record from its sleeve and gently runs the brush over the grooves before putting it on.     "
"When the cleaning lady comes, Katharina puts the things she tidies up onto the sofa, and when the room is clean, she puts them back on the floor. When she has to arrange the bookshelf, she pushes them aside. In her cabinet, there's no room for two large boxes. The cellar had just been flooded. Should she just take them to the trash like that, the way they are? She opens the top box and looks inside. Then she closes it again."
"How beautiful even the bones of such a fish are, he says, looking at the fish skeleton plate, which reminds him of a charnel house but also of the large hall in the natural history museum, where the giant dinosaur skeleton is on display.     As a child, I learned fishing from my grandfather, she says.     For a moment, he sees her sitting on a bridge with her legs dangling and holding a fishing rod in the water. How much power such a sentence has, he thinks. It conjures an image in one's head, whether one wants it to or not."
"He says, we'll only see each other occasionally, but every time should feel like the first time - a celebration. She listens attentively and nods. That must only be your luxury, he says, since I'm a married man. I know, she says. It might be that it's not enough for you, he says, and that's your right. She looks straight at him, her pupils are a yellow ring, and he sees it now. I don't just have a marriage, but also a relationship with a woman in broadcasting. And even if you had a thousand women, she says, what matters is the time we spend together. How could he ever refuse her anything if she doesn't make any demands? The black velvet bow, which makes her look like a boarding school student, moves him immeasurably. If he doesn't say what he has to say quickly, it will be too late. And we must not publicize our relationship - we both know that has to be enough. That's okay, she says, and smiles. Where conditions are negotiated, something remains. She was afraid yesterday and the whole day today that he would throw her out of his life again.  "
"Will you come to my funeral?        She looks down at the cup of coffee in front of her and says nothing.   Will you come to my funeral, he asks again.   You're still very much alive, she says.   But he asks again a third time: Will you come to my funeral?   Yes, she says, of course I will come to your funeral.        An birch tree stands next to the spot I chose.   Beautiful, she says.        Four months later, she is in Pittsburgh when she receives the news that he has passed away.   It's her birthday, but before she receives the first congratulatory message from Europe, Ludwig, his son, calls her and says: Father died today.   On her birthday.        When his funeral takes place, she is still in Pittsburgh."
"While he is now fetching wine from the kitchen, she takes a few steps into the room and looks around. Small figures and tin toys are standing in front of the books, postcards are leaning against the book spines, and photos are pinned to the boards: A little child, apparently their son, sitting on a pony, a empty landscape with clouds, a beautiful woman on a swing, probably his wife, laughing at the photographer, who is probably Hans, her husband, but she laughs now at every one who sees the photo, including the visitor, the woman who is visiting her husband's home. Behind her, he is now clinking the glasses, holding both in one hand and the bottle in the other, shall we put on some music?, he asks and heads over to the living room. Yes, she says and follows."
"For the second time, and finally once and for all, it was clear that this city was extremely harmful to him during this weather. It seemed unreasonable to stubbornly insist on staying, and the prospect of the wind changing was completely uncertain. A quick decision was required. It was impossible to return home already, nor were either summer or winter quarters ready to accept him. But not only was there the sea and the beach here, and elsewhere they could be found without the unpleasant addition of the lagoon's malaria-stricken air. He remembered a small seaside resort not far from Trieste, which had been highly recommended to him. Why not go there? And immediately, so that the repeat change of accommodation would still be worth it. He made up his mind and stood up. At the next gondola stop, he took a boat and let himself be led through the murky labyrinth of canals, under ornate marble balconies flanked by lion statues, past slippery corners, by mourning palace facades that reflected the swaying corporate signs in the falling water, to San Marco. He had difficulty getting there, for the gondolier, who was in league with fabric manufacturers and glassblowers, tried to set him down for sightseeing and shopping everywhere, and as the bizarre journey through Venice began to exert its enchantment, the entrepreneurial spirit of the fallen queen, which had befallen him, went to the trouble of sobering his sense once again."
"There is no path that leads back, neither to the wolf nor to the child. At the beginning of things, it's not innocence and simplicity; every created thing, even the seemingly simplest, is already guilty, is already multi-faceted, and is thrown into the dirty stream of becoming and can never swim upstream again. The path to innocence, to the uncreated, to God does not lead back, but forward, not to the wolf or the child, but always further into guilt, always deeper into human becoming. Even with suicide, you, wretched Steppenwolf, will not be served seriously; you will have to take the longer, more arduous, and heavier path of human becoming; you will have to multiply your duality many times over and further complicate your complexity. Instead of narrowing your world, simplifying your soul, you will have to take in more and more world, and ultimately, you will have to absorb the entire world into your painfully expanded soul in order to finally come to an end, to rest. This path has been taken by Buddha, every great person, one knowing, the other unknowing, as far as their venture succeeded.        Every birth means separation from the All, means limitation, segregation from God, painful rebirth. Return to the All, lifting of the painful individuation, becoming God means: having a soul so expanded that it can encompass the All once again."
"The figures into which you have seen your so-called personality fragment. I cannot play without figures. He held a mirror in front of me, and once again I saw the unity of my person broken down into many I's, their number seemed to be growing. The figures, however, were now very small, about the size of playing pieces, and the player took a few dozen of them with still, sure finger grips and placed them beside the chessboard on the floor. He spoke monotonously, like a man reciting a well-practiced lecture or lesson:"
"You are a small boy. And just as you were so easygoing that you didn't bother to learn to dance until it was almost too late, you were also too easygoing to learn to love. Ideal and tragic love, oh friend, you can certainly do that extremely well, I have no doubt about it, with all my respect! You will now learn to love a little bit normally and humanly. The start has been made, I'll let you go to a ball soon. Well, the Boston [style of dancing] you still need to learn, and we'll start with that tomorrow. I'll be here at 3 o'clock. By the way, how did you like the music here?"
"It's a pleasure, dear Harry, to be able to welcome you a little today. You have often been very tired of your life, have you not? You've been longing to leave this time, this world, this reality, and enter another, more suitable reality, a world without time. Do it, dear friend, I invite you to. You know where this other world is hidden, that it's the world of your own soul, which you're searching for. Only in your own inner self does that other reality live, the one you long for. I can't give you anything that doesn't already exist within you, I can't open a different picture gallery for you than the one of your soul. I can't give you anything but the opportunity, the prompt, the key. I'll help you make your own world visible, that's all."
"Do you understand a single word?"" the sales manager asked the parents, ""He's not making a fool of us, is he?"" ""Good heavens!"" the mother cried out, sobbing, ""He might be seriously ill, and we're torturing him. Grete! Grete!"" she screamed, and then. ""Mother?"" her sister called from the other side. They coordinated with each other through Gregor's room. ""You must get to the doctor at once. Gregor is ill. Quickly, get the doctor. Did you just hear Gregor speaking?"" ""That was an animal voice,"" said the sales manager, surprisingly quietly compared to the mother's screaming. ""Anna! Anna!"" the father shouted from the entrance hall into the kitchen and clapped his hands, ""Send for a locksmith immediately!"" And already the two girls were rushing out in their swirling skirts from the entrance hall - how quickly had the sister gotten dressed, after all? - and flung open the flat door. You didn't even hear the door slam shut; they must have left it open, as it is in rooms where a great misfortune has occurred."
"""Dear parents,"" said the sister and tapped her hand on the table to introduce herself, ""it can't go on like this. If you don't see it, I see it. I don't want to mention the name of my brother, that monster, and so I'll just say that we need to get rid of it. We've done everything humanly possible to care for and tolerate it, and I think nobody can fault us the slightest bit."
"What has happened to me?"" he thought. It was no dream. His room, a real room, but a bit too small for a human being, lay quietly between the four familiar walls. Above the table, where the disordered collection of sample fabrics from his travels was spread out - Gregor Samsa was a traveling salesman - hung the picture he had cut out from an illustrated magazine recently and framed in a nice, gilded frame. It depicted a lady, who, with a fur hat and fur boa, sat upright and raised a heavy fur mitten, in which her entire arm had disappeared, towards the viewer."
