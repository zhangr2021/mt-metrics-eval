"When the housekeeper arrived early one morning, filled with force and eagerness, as she often did, despite being asked to refrain, and with such a vigorous slamming of the doors that from the moment she entered, no peaceful rest could be found in the entire apartment - she found Gregor, as usual during her brief visit, showing no immediate sign of what was to come. She assumed he was deliberately remaining still, mocking her, and believed in his intellectual prowess. Unbeknownst to her, she held the long broom in her hand, so she tried to rouse Gregor from the doorway with it. When this failed, she grew annoyed and pushed a little into his body, only then realizing his immobility. Upon discovering the truth, she gasped, made an exclamation, and quickly left, opening the bedroom door loudly and shouting into the darkness: ""Look, it's crawling; there it is, completely crawling!""        Translation by AI:   As early in the morning, when the maid arrived, brimming with energy and hurriedly, as she had often been instructed not to, she slammed doors so violently that from that moment, no rest could be found in the apartment - her usual, brief visit started without any notable peculiarity. Assuming Gregor was intentionally remaining motionless and acting the indignant, she trusted his intelligence. Because she happened to carry the long broom, she tried to rattle him from the door. When this attempt was futile, she became angered and inadvertently pushed against Gregor. It was only when she could see him without resistance that she became attentive. When she grasped the situation, she widened her eyes, exclaimed, but did not linger for long. She slammed the bedroom door open and with a loud voice announced into the darkness, ""Just look, it's squirming; there it is, thoroughly squirming!"""
"As silence replaces sorrow and anguish, the two bodies lie side by side in darkness. Hans thinks, Never again will it be like this today, and Katharina reflects, This is how it will remain forever. Then, sleep erases all thoughts, leaving their experience imprinted on their brain, as they lay quietly together.        Translation:        Where once sorrow and weeping reigned, now stillness reigns. Hans realizes, This will never be like today again, while Katharina decides, It's how it will forever be. Sleep eradicates all traces, forever writing their encounter onto their minds, as they rest in tranquility side by side."
"She, too, has a suitcase filled with letters, postcards, and keepsakes, mostly mundane items, as archives speak of it. She has her diaries and calendars. The following day, she ascends the bookshelf and retrieves the suitcase from the upper shelf, dusty both inside and out. Ages ago, the papers from his boxes and hers seemed to converse with one another. Now, they engage in a dialogue with time. In that suitcase, in that cardboard box, the beginning, the end, and the middle coexist indistinctly amidst the dust of decades. There lies the deceptive writing and the truth, the concealed and the expressed, all intertwined densely, conflicting ideas as silent as unspoken anger and love, trapped together in a single envelope, in the same file, where forgotten moments fade away, just as neatly, as the ones we can recall, however dimly or brightly. As Katharina sifts through the old folders, her hands becoming dusty, she remembers her father's magician-like presence at her children's birthdays. He would scatter a stack of playing cards into the air and, somehow, always pick the one that one of them, including herself, had seen beforehand."
"Above the opera café, the sky grew dark, and a thunderstorm broke out at the Crown Prince Palace, drenching passengers as the bus halted at Marx-Engels-Plaza and the doors opened. Many people hurried in to seek shelter from the downpour. Thus, she, who initially stood at the entrance, was pushed to the center along with them."
"From that dream, the wanderer awoke, unsettled, broken, and without strength, surrendering to the demon. He no longer feared the watchful gazes of people; it didn't bother him if they attributed their suspicions. Indeed, they too had fled or left; many beach huts stood empty, the dining hall indicated greater vacuity, and in the city, one seldom saw strangers anymore. The truth seemed to spread, but despite the stubborn unity of the interested parties, panic could not be held back. But the woman adorned with pearls remained, whether shielded from the rumors or too proud and fearless to evade them - Tadzio stayed. In his expanse, it sometimes felt as though flight and death could remove all distractions from the circle, leaving him alone with the Beauty on this island. Indeed, when, in the early morning, his gaze, deliberate, unaccountable, and unwavering, rested on the desired object across the sea, or as he followed the illicit death in hidden streets during descending days, feeling unworthy, he found the abyssal allure irresistible and the moral law внушимо阴道."
"The sky was gray, the wind damp; the harbor and islands were left behind, rapidly disappearing from the blurred horizon as all land vanished into the mist. clouds of coal dust, darkened by moisture, settled onto the washed deck that refused to dry. Within an hour, a sailcloth roof was raised, for it began to rain."
"The sister rushed to their mother and put her hand on her forehead. The father, seemingly inspired by the sister's words, had risen from his chair, now fiddling with his butler's cap between the still remaining dishes from the chamberlain's dinner, and occasionally glanced at the silent Gregor."
"The doors closed, the bus pulled away, and she searched for a handrail.        And there he saw her.        And she saw him.        Outside, a genuine flood descended, and indoors, the air was thick with moisture from the damp clothes of the passengers.        Now the bus stopped at Alex. But the stop was beneath the subway bridge."
"This Hermione, whom I saw for the second time today, seemed to know everything about me. It seemed impossible to keep any secrets from her. Perhaps she didn't fully grasp the intricacies of my inner life; perhaps her understanding of my relationship with music, Goethe, Novalis, or Baudelaire was limited – but even this was uncertain. In any case, it didn't seem to bother her much. And what remained of my ""inner life""? Wasn't it reduced to ruins, losing its meaning? However, I had no doubt about her ability to understand all my personal concerns and烦恼. Soon, we would delve into discussions about The Stranger, the Treatise, and everything that until now had only existed within me, never shared with another person. I couldn't resist starting our conversation right away."
"Once, it had been a month since Gregor's transformation, and for his sister, it no longer seemed so extraordinary to be surprised by his appearance. She came a little earlier than usual and found Gregor still sitting immobile by the window, looking exceptionally terrifying as he peered out. It wouldn't have been out of character for him to prevent her from entering the room by his position, preventing him from opening the window immediately. However, she did not enter but, instead, retreated and shut the door behind her. One might have thought Gregor had been waiting to catch her and bite her, as he seemed to have them on edge.        Gregor, of course, immediately hid under the couch. But he had to wait until midday for his sister to return, and she appeared even more restless than usual. He realized that her sight of him remained unbearable, and it would likely continue to be so, as she struggled to avert her gaze from the part of his body that protruded from under the couch. To spare her from this sight, one day he carried a sheet on his back – a task that took him four hours – and arranged it so thoroughly that he was completely concealed. Even when she stooped to look, she couldn't see him.        If this sheet was not necessary, she could have easily removed it, considering that isolating herself from him in such a manner was inherently evident. Yet, she left it as is, and Gregor even seemed to catch a faint look of gratitude when he cautiously lifted the sheet a bit to observe her reaction to the new arrangement."
"He pours her wine, white for the fish, and notices by the side that she knows how to fillet one. She sees his spectacles case on the table and the Duett cigarette box, and realizes she will never sit at a table again without his spectacles and cigarettes nearby."
"Exhausted and dulled by the chaos of that unusual morning, he slumped into an armchair by the open window after dispersing the contents of his pocket within the room. The sea had taken on a pale green hue, the air seemed thinner and purer, the shore, with its huts and boats, appeared more vibrant, even though the sky was still gray. Aschenbach looked out, his hands folded in his lap, content to be back but frustrated by his own wavering, his ignorance of his desires. He sat there for an hour, silently and idly lost in thought.   At noon, he spotted Tadzio, dressed in striped linen and a red mask, making his way back to the hotel from the sea. From his elevated vantage point, Aschenbach recognized him before he fully caught sight of him, and he attempted to think, ""Look, Tadzio, there you are again!"" But in the same instant, he felt the casual greeting falter before the truth of his heart, fading away and silencing. He sensed the passion of his blood, the joy and pain in his soul, and understood that his parting from Tadzio had become such a burden."
"""It's nice to walk beside him,"" she thinks.        ""It's nice to walk beside her,"" he thinks.        Twenty minutes' walk through the night. He knows the place well, having been there numerous times before. The waiter, as usual, shows him to the table reserved for regular customers."
"It was a song that no solitary person remembered ever having heard; a boisterous ditty in an indecipherable dialect, accompanied by a laugh-filled chorus that the band eagerly sang from the bottom of their lungs. Both the words and the instrumentals fell silent, leaving behind only an rhythmically organized, yet unpretentious laughter that the soloist possessed the unique talent to inflate with incredible vivacity. With the restored artistic distance between him and the authority figures, his audacity had returned, and his mock laughter, pushed mercilessly onto the terrace, was a thunderous cackle.        As the articulate part of the stanza reached its peak, a irresistible tickle seemed to battled within him. He coughed, his voice wavering, his hand covering his mouth, his shoulders tensing. Suddenly, an unbridled laughter burst forth, so genuine that it传播感染， undeniable to the listeners, even on the terrace. It seemed to multiply the singer's abandon.        He bowed, touched his knees, pulled at his sides, as if seeking relief. His laughter gave way to shouting, as if pointing to nothing more ridiculous than the laughing company up above. And then, laughter echoed through the garden, on the veranda, even to the butlers, liftboys, and servants in the rooms, silencing their surroundings."
"Early at five, ten o'clock Berlin time, she arrives promptly for the ceremony, places a candle on the hotel table, lights it, and plays music for him from the internet.        The second movement of Mozart's D-Major Concerto.   The aria from the Goldberg Variations by Bach.   Chopin's A-Minor Mazurka.        Each of these pieces has interruptions where advertisements are displayed.        The new Hyundai. A bank offering home loans. A medication for coughs.        When she returns from Pittsburgh to Berlin six weeks later, she notices the fresh sandhill and the birch tree. The roses she placed on his grave, sent by a friend, have already been removed. Her friend tells her about the funeral, how music was played.        ""What's that?"" she asks.        Mozart, Bach, and Chopin, her friend replies.        She nods.        Half a year later, her husband is at home when a woman delivers two large cartons.        She cried, he says, I gave her a handkerchief.        For months, the cartons remain in Katharina's workspace."
"At the shipbuilding embankment on Ganymed, his wife had told him that she was pregnant. On Ganymed, he had celebrated with his editor the first printer-ready manuscript. Now, he stands before the venue, waiting for a nineteenth-year-old girl.        The nineteen-year-old girl had known his face, his nose, and his shoulders all day yesterday and today. But now, judging from his overall appearance, she might not remember him anymore. Impatiently, she approaches her memory."
"Back in the hotel, he immediately went to the lobby and scanned the newspapers. There was nothing in the foreign sections. The domestic rumors carried uncertain numbers, offered official denials, and questioned their authenticity. Thus, the departure of the German and Austrian elements made sense. The inhabitants of the other nations seemed oblivious, unaware, and undisturbed. ""Silence!"" Aschenbach thought excitedly as he threw the newspapers on the table. ""Silence must be maintained!"" But at the same time, his heart swelled with satisfaction at the adventure the outer world was getting into. For passion, like crime, sought to disrupt the daily routine and well-being, and every ruffle in the social order, every turmoil and disturbance, was welcome to her, as she could somewhere, undefined, find advantage. Aschenbach felt a dark satisfaction towards the officially orchestrated incidents in the squalid alleys of Venice – this sinister secret of the city,融入了他自身最私密的秘密， for which he himself felt a deep responsibility. For the lover cared nothing about Tadzio's departure, and could barely bear to imagine his own life without him."
"Kairos, the god of lucky moments, it is said, has a lock above his forehead, the only place one can hold on to him. But once he steps on his feathered feet, he unveils the bare back of the skull - it is bare and lifeless, with nothing to grasp. Was the moment that, as a nineteen-year-old girl, she encountered Hans, a blessed one? On an autumn day in early November, she sits on the floor and begins to sift through the contents of the first, then the second cardboard box. It's a barren wasteland. The oldest records are from 1986, while the newest are from 1992. She finds letters, copies of letters, notes, receipts, yearbooks, photographs, negatives, postcards, collages, and scattered newspaper clippings. In her hand, she crushes a piece of sugar from the Café Kranzler. Tattered pages fall out between the pages, leaving pass photos tacked to them with paper clips, and in a matchbox, a bunch of hair is hidden."
"Softly, apologetically, he regretted the incident, calling it extremely embarrassing for himself and the institution, but with conviction, he endorsed Aschenbach's decision to wait for the luggage here. Of course, his room was already assigned, though a different one, not worse, immediately available. ""Bad luck, sir,"" the Swiss lift operator smiled as they ascended. And so the refugee was resettled once more, into a room that, in terms of size and furnishings, was almost identical to the previous one."
"Carefully, he chose a larger table, the three of us will be, he told the waiter. Now that she's aware, they glance around occasionally, searching for the missing third. For the appetizer, he explained, one must definitely have Bernese Butterbouillon, it contains a nest of eggs. So, they ladle the creamy broth, raise each egg to their spoon, marveling at the wonder. An eggshell, he emphasized, drawing attention to the last word, looking expectantly at her to see if she gets the joke. She meets his gaze. Their first shared word is born. And he brings her a book, so she knows what he's writing. It's his first gift for her, a dedication to read later. Then, they glance over to the door, shaking their heads - where is the tardy one? In silent understanding, they share their first secrets, knowing the only thing they'll remember when they look at each other. That's why he must clarify the conditions before it's too late."
"After several years of turmoil, with intermittent stays here and there, he chose Munich as his permanent residence early on and lived there in a respectable, if not exalted, civilian status, the kind that is sometimes granted to the spirit in exceptional cases. His marriage, entered into at a young age with a girl from a scholarly family, ended in short-lived happiness following her death. He had a daughter who had become his wife, but he never had a son."
"Recently, he no longer contented himself with simply acknowledging the presence and beauty of the day's phenomenon and joy; he pursued it, stalking his shadow. On Sundays, for instance, the Poles never appeared by the shore; he sensed that they attended Mass at San Marco and rushed there. As he emerged from the fervor of the place into the golden haze of the sanctuary, he found the Penitent, prostrate before the altar during the service. Then, he stood in the background, on the fragmented mosaic floor, amidst a kneeling, murmuring, and fervently clapping crowd. The resplendent grandeur of the oriental temple heavily burdened his senses. In front, the adorned priest walked, shuffled, and sang, incense wafted, enveloping the feeble flames of the ancient candlesticks. Amid the dense, pungent aroma of the sacrificial offering, a subtle third scent融入: the scent of the sick city. Through the mist and commotion, Ashenbach observed the Beautiful turn and seek him there, finally seeing him."
"He often spent the entire nights there, not Dozing for a moment, but rather scraping the leather for hours on end. Or he didn't hesitate to drag a chair to the window, then爬 up the frame and, perched in the chair, lean against the window, apparently merely as a fleeting memory of the liberating act it once held for him – to look out the window. For day by day, the things just beyond his line of sight grew murkier, and the hospital across, which he had once detested for its constant presence, faded from his sight. Without knowing precisely where he was in the quiet yet bustling Charlottenstraße, he might have assumed he was staring out at a wilderness, with the gray sky and earth blending seamlessly into one another from his window. Only twice did the attentive sister notice the chair by the window – after tidying up the room, she always effortlessly returned it to its exact spot, even from then on leaving the inner window panel ajar."
"He was already so far gone that even a stronger sway almost took him off balance. Before long, he had no choice but to make a final decision; it was already five minutes past eight when the doorbell rang. ""Someone from the office,"" he thought, momentarily frozen as his feet danced frantically. The silence endured for a moment. ""They won't open,"" Gregor muttered, engulfed in a hopeless hope. But naturally, the maid came to the door in her usual firm stride and opened it. Gregor could hear the visitor's first greeting and instantly recognized who it was – the auditor himself. Why was Gregor cursed with working at a company where even the slightest mistake triggered the worst suspicions? Were all the employees, including himself, really so inherently corrupt, or was there no one, regardless of their loyalty, who, if they skipped a few hours for work, would feel a pang of conscience and struggle so much to leave the bed? Did it really require the auditor's personal intervention – if such investigation was even necessary – or was the Procurator demonstrating to the innocent family that only his judgment could be trusted in this suspicious matter? And in the midst of his agitation, rather than a clear resolution, Gregor's strength deserted him, and with all his might, he pulled himself out of bed. There was a loud thud, but it wasn't a genuine uproar. A part of the sound was muffled by the carpet, and his spine, which he had assumed to be immobile, offered more resilience than he imagined. Thus, the less attention-grabbing dull thud echoed. It was his head that had not been handled with care; he turned it, angrily rubbing it against the carpet for pain and discomfort."
"She knows that one lays the napkin over the knees before starting to eat, she knows to wipe her mouth before drinking, and she knows to place the soup spoon on the back of the plate, not inwards. She understands that one does not rest their elbows and does not cut potatoes with the fork. In the face of all fear, hope, and the unpredictable, this knowledge brings comfort, for it reminds her that one places their cutlery together, the knife on the right side of the plate, once the meal is done.        Facing this man at dinner that evening, towering as a blessing, a calamity, and a question, she understands: Now, life has truly begun, all other preparations leading up to this.         He believes she still looks beautiful as she eats."
"Such forgettable thoughts wandered through his mind as he stuck to the door, listening intently. Sometimes, weariness so overpowered him that he could barely pay attention anymore and let his head droop against the door, only to grip it tightly again. The slightest creak he caused had been heard next door and had silenced everyone. ""What he's driving at,"" said the father after a moment, addressing the door, and only then did the interrupted conversation resume gradually."
"Tadzio, accompanied by three or four of his remaining playmates, moved towards the right of the hut where he lived, and reclining in his chair with a blanket draped over his knees, resting somewhere between the sea and the row of beach huts, he glanced once more at Aschenbach. The unattended game, as the women were preoccupied with travel preparations, seemed random and degenerated into a chaotic spectacle. The burly individual, dressed in a beltless robe and with his black, pomaded hair, known as ""Jaschu,"" was piqued by a sandthrow and blinded, forcing Tadzio into a bout, which swiftly ended with the weaker one's fall.        But in that moment of departure, the sense of inferiority seemed to turn into savage ruthlessness, and the victor, rather than releasing the vanquished, continued to hold him down on his back, his face buried深深的 in the sand, suffocating Tadzio, despite being exhausted from the fight. Tadzio's desperate attempts to lift the struggling one off failed, and they repeated themselves only as feeble twitching.        Desperate to intervene, Aschenbach stood, ready to spring to Tadzio's aid, but the violent brute finally released his victim. Tadzio, very pale, was half-asleep, sitting with an arm for support for several minutes, his hair disheveled and his eyes dulled. Then, he gradually rose and walked away slowly. They called out to him at first cheerfully, then anxiously, beseechingly; he did not hear. The black man, likely feeling remorse for his outburst, approached and tried to apologize, but Tadzio merely moved his shoulder in rejection. He walked diagonally towards the water, barefoot and wearing his striped linen pants with a red ribbon.        Translation:        Tadzio, accompanied by a few remaining playmates, walked to the right of the hut, his knees hidden under a blanket while resting in a chair, between the sea and the line of beach huts. He glanced one last time at Aschenbach, who observed an unattended, chaotic game, as the women were occupied with travel arrangements. A sandthrow triggered a duel between a burly figure called ""Jaschu,"" who in his beltless robe and black, pomaded hair, blinded Tadzio into a swift defeat.        In the twilight of departure, the victor's initial sense of power seemed to transform into cruel ferocity. Despite Tadzio's weakness, he didn't let go, pinning the submissive down with his weight, his face burrowed into the sand. Tadzio, panting from the fight, struggled, but his efforts proved futile, amounting only to feeble twitchings.        Aschenbach, horror-stricken, rose to save Tadzio but was met by the victor, who finally released his victim. Tadzio, pale, half-asleep, remained motionless for a few moments, supported by one arm, his hair tousled and his eyes shadowed. He then slowly stood and walked away, ignoring their calls that started off encouragingly but turned pleading. The remorseful black man tried to apologize, but Tadzio brushed him aside. He headed toward the water, barefoot, in his striped linen with a red ribbon."
"And now he plays for her an impromptu in As-Dur by Franz Schubert, and the Chromatic Fantasy by Bach, the Partita in e-Moll, and the third movement from Mozart's B-Dur piano concerto. Sometimes he nods his head in time with the rhythm, and then he says, ""Isn't that something?"" She responds, ""That's beautiful."" She asks, ""Who's playing?"" And he answers, ""Artur Rubinstein, Glenn Gould, Clara Haskill."" They've passed between Bach and Mozart, and she saw the son's underwear on a hanger in the bathroom. And by the mirror, there's the perfume bottle that gives the room its distinct scent, Chanel No. 5. And three toothbrushes in a cup. And on a chair, the woman's nightgown carelessly thrown away. Come, dear May, and make the trees green again, the piano sighs at the end, but it's already July. The evening has turned into a summer night, the wine glass is empty. Are you hungry? Yes. Let's go eat then. Yes."
"And now?        Without either of them needing to say a word about it, they resume their steps in the opposite direction. For them, ""homeward"" now means returning to his house.        From below, they look upwards towards the still brightly lit windows."
"And so, she resisted her mother's attempt to persuade her, who seemed disoriented by the turmoil in the room, growing quiet and lending her sister all the strength she could to remove the chest. Gregor knew he could temporarily survive without the chest, but the desk had to remain. Almost immediately after the women, heaving with strain, left the room with the chest, Gregor pushed his head up from the couch, determined to move cautiously and as tactfully as possible. Unfortunately, it was their mother who returned first, while Grete was in the adjacent room, swaying the chest back and forth, obviously not budging it. Unaccustomed to Gregor's appearance, the mother could have been alarmed, and in a panic, he惶ently retreated backward to the far end of the couch, though he could not prevent the front of the sheet from shifting slightly. That足以 to catch the mother's attention. She paused, stood still for a moment, and then returned to Grete."
"And although Gregor, due to his wound, was probably permanently impaired in mobility and spent an extremely long time, crawling across his room like an old invalid - crawling upstairs was out of the question - he regarded this worsening of his condition as more than adequate compensation. Specifically, every evening, at a time he had been carefully monitoring for two to three hours beforehand, the living room door would be opened, allowing him, lying in the darkness of his room, to observe the entire family at the illuminated table and listen to their conversations, as if with their tacit permission, in a completely different manner than before."
"""Our star,"" he says, ""can't enter the Earth's atmosphere or it will combust immediately. So the star remains up there, securely nailed to the heavens like the photos on my bookshelf, she thinks relief. She nods. She says yes. He knows it's making it hard for her to say yes, that's the refrain that comes to him. 'Infallibles牺牲品,' the song goes, 'those are the ones who can bring the offering.'"""
"Perhaps he only went out with her to be able to return. To maintain the illusion that everyday life would be familiar to her, just as it is to him. She already proceeds to the living room ahead of him, while he retrieves another bottle of wine from the kitchen. When he enters the room, she stands at the window. The window sill is low enough for it to be effortless to topple over, she thinks. Over there, she says, someone is still awake. It's a good friend of ours, he adds, who paints. You must be aware that I am referring to 'us,' he assumes, hoping she will understand. She turns to face him. He holds a record in his hand, smoke dangles precariously from the corner of his lips. Take the cigarette from your mouth, you dog. Here's the Requiem. That doesn't seem right now, she remarks. Now, she said. The dead in the ground do not sleep, but wait. Good music always fits, he replies, setting down his cigarette. Then, she says. He removes the disc from its case and delicately strokes the grooves with the brush, before setting it aside."
"When the cleaner arrives, Katharina moves the cartons onto the couch, and once the room is tidy, she returns them to the floor. If she has to organize the bookshelves, she pushes them aside. There's no space for two large cartons in her cabinet. The cellar was just flooded. Should she dispose of them as they are? She lifts the top carton and peeks inside, then sets it back down again."
"How beautiful the scales are on such a fish, he comments, looking at the scale tray that reminds him both of a bait house and the grand hall in the natural history museum, where the massive dinosaur skeleton is displayed.        As a child, I learned to fish from my grandfather, she recalls.        For a moment, he observes her standing wobbly on a bridge, holding a fishing rod and the thought crosses his mind how potent a sentence can be, imprinting an image in your mind, whether you want it to or not."
"""We will see each other only occasionally,"" he says, ""but it should always be like the first time – a celebration."" She listens attentively and nods. ""It can only be your luxury,"" he continues, ""because I am married."" She understands. ""It could be that's not enough for you,"" he says, ""and that's your right."" Directly, she looks him in the eye, and he notices her pupils are now a golden ring. ""I have not only a marriage, but also a relationship with a woman from the broadcasting industry."" And even if you had a thousand women,"" she replies, ""it's really about the time we spend together."" How can he ever reject her when she doesn't ask for anything? The black velvet tie, making her seem like a schoolgirl, deeply affects him. If he doesn't speak up quickly when he wants to say something, it will be too late. And we can't announce our relationship publicly – we both know that's enough. ""That's fine,"" she says with a smile. When conditions are negotiated, it's about something that remains constant. She was terrified yesterday and all day today of him pushing her back into his life so quickly."
"Will you come to my funeral?   She looks down at the coffee cup in front of her and says nothing.   Will you come to my funeral? He asks again.   She says, you're not even dead.   But he asks for the third time, Will you come to my funeral?   Yes, she says, of course I will come to your funeral.   A birch tree stands beside the spot I have chosen.   Nice, she remarks.   Four months later, when she receives the news of his death, she is in Pittsburgh. It's her birthday, but before any congratulations from Europe, Ludwig, her son, calls and says, Father has passed away today.   On her birthday.   When the funeral takes place, she is still in Pittsburgh."
"While he fetches the wine from the kitchen, she takes a few steps into the room and surveys the surroundings. Small figures and pewter toys sit before the books, postcards are propped against the spines, and photographs are tacked to the walls: a small child, presumably their son, riding a pony, an empty landscape with clouds, a beautiful woman in a Hollywood swing, likely his wife, laughing at the photographer, who might be Hans, her husband, but her laughter transcends the photograph, reaching anyone who views it, including her visitor. Now, glasses tinkle behind her, he holds both in one hand and carries the bottle in the other, does she want to listen to some music? he asks, heading towards the living room. Yes, she responds, and follows."
"For the second time, and now definitively, it had been proven that this city was highly detrimental to his health under these weather conditions. Resisting stubbornly seemed irrational, the prospect of a change in the wind uncertain. Speedy decision-making was needed. Even returning home was no longer an option. Neither his summer nor winter quarters were prepared to accommodate him. Yet, not just here did they offer the sea and beach, but elsewhere, they found solace without the negative influence of the lagoon and its feverish aura. He recalled a small sea bathing spot not far from Trieste, which they had praised highly. Why not go there? And without delay, so that the repeated change of residence would still justify itself. He determined himself and stood up. At the next gondola stop, he hailed a boat and was ferried through the intricate canals, under elegantly decorated marble balconies adorned with lion sculptures, past slippery seawalls that reflected melancholic palace facades with hanging company logos in the water, directed toward San Marco. He struggled to reach his destination, as the gondolier, sympathetic to silk factories and glassblowers, attempted to entice him into visits and purchases at every opportunity. And as the bizarre journey through Venice began to enchant, the cunning wit of the fallen queen's entrepreneurial spirit served to dampen the mood once more."
"None of the ways leads back, not to the wolf, nor to the child. At the beginning of all things, innocence and simplicity are not; everything created, even the simplest, is already guilty, multifaceted, tossed into the murky river of becoming and can never, never swim upstream again. The path towards innocence, towards the uncreated, towards God does not lead backward but forward, not to the wolf or child, but further into guilt, deeper into the human formation. Even suicide will not seriously serve you, poor Steppe wolf, for you will have to walk the longer, more arduous, and heavier path of human manifestation, you will have to multiply your duality many times over, complicate your intricacy much more. Instead of narrowing your world, simplifying your soul, you will accumulate more world, ultimately needing to take your exponentially expanded soul into the entire, painfully expanded world, perhaps hoping for a fleeting moment of rest at the end. This path is the one walked by Buddha, and by every great human who knew or unknowingly dared, as far as their courage allowed. Each birth signifies separation from all, limitation, subtraction from God, and painful rebirth. Return to the whole, the lifting of the painful individuality, becomes: having a soul so expanded that it can encompass the whole once again."
"The figures, through which you perceive your so-called personality breaking down. Without figures, I cannot act. He held up a mirror before me, and again, I saw the unity of my self shattered into many 'I's, their count seemingly multiplying. But now, these figures were incredibly tiny, roughly the size of handy chess pieces. The player approached them with quiet, sure-handed grasp, plucking several dozen and setting them beside the chessboard on the ground. monotonously, as if reciting a lecture or address he had often delivered before, he spoke:  "
"You are a little boy. Just like how it was comfortable for you to learn to dance almost too late, you were also too comfortable in learning to love. Dear friend, you are certainly skilled in this, I have no doubt about it! Now, you will start learning to love a bit more conventionally and humanly. The foundation has been laid, and you'll be ready to attend a ball soon. Well, we'll begin with Boston tomorrow. I'll be here at three. By the way, how did the music here suit you?"
"""It gives me pleasure, dear Harry, to allow you a little pampering today. You've often seemed overburdened by your life here, always striving to move on, am I right? You long to leave behind this time, this world, this reality and enter one that suits you better, a world without time. Do so, dear friend, I invite you. You know where that other world is concealed - it is the world of your own soul, the one you seek. Only within yourself does that other reality exist. I can offer you nothing that doesn't already exist within you; I can show you no other picture gallery than the one in your own heart. All I can provide is the opportunity, the stimulus, the key. I assist you in making your own world visible, that's all.""     "
"""Did you even understand a word he said?"" asked the procurator to the parents, ""is he really playing a joke on us?"" ""For God's sake,"" wailed the mother, tears streaming down her face, ""maybe he's very sick and we're just tormenting him. Grete! Grete!"" she screamed. ""Mother?"" called the sister from the other side, understanding each other through Gregor's room. ""You must go to the doctor immediately. Gregor is sick. Hurry to the doctor. Did you hear Gregor talking just now?"" ""That was a beastly sound,"" the procurator said, speaking in a surprising whisper amidst the mother's screams. ""Anna! Anna!"" called the father from the living room, clapping his hands, ""find a locksmith immediately!"" And the two girls, their dresses billowing, rushed out of the living room as if they had dressed in a hurry - how had the sister managed to change so quickly? - and yanked the apartment door open. They didn't even hear the door slam; they had probably left it ajar, as it's customary in apartments where a terrible calamity has occurred."
"""Dear Parents,"" said the sister and, as a prelude, thumped the table with her hand, ""this cannot go on. If you don't understand this, I do. I will not utter my brother's name in front of this beast and therefore simply say: we must try to escape. We have done everything in our power to care for and tolerate it, I believe there's no one who can hold us accountable for that."""
"""What's happened to me?"" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a quaint and slightly small human room, lay peacefully between the four familiar walls. Above the table, which was adorned with an unpacked collection of fabric patterns – Samsa being a traveler – hung the picture he had recently cut out from an illustrated magazine and framed beautifully in a gilded frame. It depicted a woman sitting upright, clad in a fur hood and muff, her entire forearm concealed inside a heavy fur muff, as she faced the viewer with an expectant look."
