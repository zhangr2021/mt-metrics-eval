4.1 General
This file contains characters that are single-byte, double-word, or four-byte encoded.
The single-byte portion includes all 128 characters in GB/T 11383-1989, from 0x00 to 0x7F.
4.3 Double-byte part
All of the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, CJK unified Chinese characters, and portions of the graphic characters in GB/T 13000 are included in the double-byte component.
In Appendix A, the characters in the double-byte section are listed.
Among these, the Appendix B requirements must be followed for the graphics, code places, and functions of ideographic descriptors.
Note:  The standard Chinese character encoding used in China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other nations and regions is called GB/T 13000.
Chinese characters with distinctive abstract glyphs are given their own code positions, while characters with the same abstract glyph but from various sources are given a similar code position.
CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea, and the encoded Chinese characters are referred to as CJK unified Chinese characters or CCJK Unified Ideographs.
4.4 Four-byte part
The text lists various Chinese characters in different standards, including GB/T 13000, .CJK unified character extensions A and C/D, and expansions.
The characters in the four-byte section adhere to Appendix C's rules.
5 Overall structure
The text uses hexadecimal notation for integers marked with a 0x, whereas decimal notation is used for values without a 0x.
The appendix's codes are all expressed in hexadecimal, while decimal is used for all other values.
The single-byte portion uses the GB/T 11383-1989 encoding scheme and the code points 0x00–0x7F.
1st byte: 0x81-0xFE, last byte: 0x40-0x7E, 0x80-0xFE double-word component uses two 8-bit binary strings for each letter.
The coding range for the four-byte component is 0x81308130-0xFE39FE39, while the suffix used to expand the double-byte code is 0x30-0x39, which was not utilized in GB/Work 11383-1989.
The first character of a four-byte character has an encoding range of 0x81-0xFE; the second character's range is 0x30-0x39; the third byte's range is 0x81-0xFE; and the fourth character's range is 0x30 A 0x39. Right now: 0x81308130-0x81308139; 0x81308230-0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30-0x8130FE39; 0x81318130-0x81318139; Oo2douolag0c "0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30-0xFE39FE39.

If we find that the content of this manual page is causing significant confusion and complaints due to being outdated, we will stop publishing it. There is no other choice, like updating the Info file and the man manual at the same time, because other maintenance work on Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project considers the man manual to be an outdated product and time should be spent elsewhere.

DESCRIPTION The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The suffix of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
GCC considers preprocessed files (.i) as C files, and sets up C-style linking.
G++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and sets the connection in C++.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and subsequent actions:
.C source code that does preprocessing, compilation, and gathering
.C++ source code for preprocessing, compilation, and gathering
.C++ source code for preprocessing, compilation, and get together
. amassing, compiling, and planning CXX C++ source code
Preprocessing, compilation, and gathering for the.m Objective-C source program
Preprocessing, compilation, and gathering for the.m Objective-C source program
preprocessed.ii record for c++; compile and gather
program in get together dialect (.s); gathering
gathering dialect preprocessing; source program
.h Preprocessor records are given to the linker, along side records with different addition names that aren't regularly found on the command line (Linker). ordinarily comprise of
.0 protest record (Question record)
.a File record (Document record)
Within the nonattendance of the -cec, -s, or -E choices, connecting is continuously the final step (or compilation blunders avoid the total prepare).
All source program.e records, -1 library records, and obscure record names (counting specified.o H standard records and.a library records) are conveyed to the linker within the association stage within the arrange indicated by the command line alternatives (Choices)
Parameters must be indicated separately since "de" and "-d -r" are totally diverse.
The larger part of "-=E:" and "-W" choices have two polar alternate extremes: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Here, as it were designs that are not among the standard choices are recorded.
All of the alternatives are recorded here, organized by kind, with clarifications taking after.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly indicate that the language of subsequent input files is language (instead of the default selection from the filename suffix).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered. The language is optional.
Turn off any explicit explanation of the language, so process the files after the file name suffix based on RE AS E `-x' option).
If only a portion of the four stages (Preprocess, Compile, Compile, Connect) is operated, the ` -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or compile source files, ETER. In the absence of ERA ATI, GCC is used by `.o' to replace the source file name with the post-level `.ec filename. Other options can be used to choose the name.
The target file.
After compilation, it stops and does not proceed to assembly.
During the compilation process, pipelines are used instead of temporary files, as the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines. This is not a problem for GNU's assembler, which can accept a C "dialect" that supports ANSI standard C programs.
This will close some features in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as rarely used ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, and despite the use of all standard libraries available in the hosted environment (note: in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. In the corresponding freestanding environment, there is no standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website).
Treat work statements that do not have parameters, like "int foo ();," within the C way, which implies you shouldn't indicate the number or kind of parameters. (C++ as it were) .
In C++, a function like foo often indicates that the argument is empty.
Here, segment postings have been trimmed in an exertion to suit a few highlights of customary C compilers.
Subtle elements can be found within the NU c handbook; we evacuated them so that perusers wouldn't HERI when the data was not pertinent.
With one exception: the “-traditional” option has the unintended side effect of enabling assignment to this for C++ applications (but not C).
It has the same impact as the "-Ethis-is-variable" alternative.
-traditional-cpp bolsters a number of highlights of the customary Cc preprocessor.
Especially, the preprocessor demonstrated over, but not the other results of the "-conventional" alternative.
-fdollars-in-identifiers “$” characters are allowed in identifiers (as it were in C++).
The "-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers" alternative can be utilized to particularly cripple the "$" character.
(On a few target frameworks, GNU C++ licenses the “$” character by default, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv (MEF C++) Allow verifiable change of subterranean insect sorts to identification sorts.
Enum to int change is ordinarily allowed in GNU C++, but not the other way around.
-fexternal—templates Decrease the estimate of format affirmations (as it were in C++) by replicating each layout work as it were where it is characterized.
For this choice to work, all template-using records must be checked with "#pragma implementatio" (definition) or "#Pragma interface" (announcement).
Format instantiations are all outside sorts when a program is compiled with the alternative "-fexternal-templates". The execution file's essential occurrences must be made to seem.
With typedefs, which make reference to each required occasion, this is often conceivable.
Hence, all format occasions are expressly indicated as built-ins when compiling with the default "-fno-exteznal-templates" choice.
All part capacities are dealt with as virtual capacities of the encasing lesson, with the exemption of constructor capacities and the mnew and erase part administrators.
Not each call to a part work will essentially go through the inside vtable as a result of this.
A virtual work may once in a while be able to be called specifically in case the compiler decides it can; in this case, it'll be.
-fcond-mismatch Acknowledge a sort jumble between the condition expression's moment and third contentions.
Such an expression incorporates a esteem of Void. Task to typically permitted (as it were in C++) utilizing the hail -fthis—is-variable.
Assignable "this" got to be out of date when user-defined free capacity administration was included to C++.
Task to this interior a course part work is in this way by default a lawful operation.
With the “-fthis-is-variable” choice, you'll permit this in spite of the fact that for in reverse compatibility.
-funsigned-char Characterize char as a sort that's unsigned, comparable to unsigned char.
Each machine features a one of a kind default char sort. It may well be either marked or unsigned char.
When depending on the signedness of the information, a convenient program ought to continuously utilize marked char or unsigned chaz.
However, a part of apps as it were back plain char and anticipate this to be marked (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is composed for).
This choice and its inverse constrain the identical default behavior for that program.
Indeed in spite of the fact that a char carries on absolutely like one of them, its sort ought to continuously be explicitly expressed as either a marked char or an unsigned char.
These alternatives are utilized to characterize marked or unsigned bitfields in case no “signed” or “unsigned” modifiers are explicitly given.
In spite of the fact that the basic numbers sorts they infer from, like int, are marked, bitfields are marked by default; be that as it may, in the event that the “-traditional” alternative is provided, bitfields are continuously unsigned.
String constants are not given uncommon treatment by -fwritable-strings; instep, they are put away within the writable information fragment.
Typically done to guarantee compatibility with more seasoned applications that do not think it's a great thought to alter string constants, the same result is accomplished utilizing the “-traditional” choice.
Executive summary
Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
The impact may be similar to that of the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health services to the point of collapse, and restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruption in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the epidemic is unknown and difficult to predict, but it is likely to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers who are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but some lessons can still be learned from past crises.
A few sedate clients begun searching for less costly manufactured drugs amid the 2008 budgetary emergency, and their drug-using propensities changed to sedate infusion.
Governments have moreover diminished financing for drug-related programs.
Intercessions like medicate utilize and related hazard behavior anticipation and medicate treatment programs may be extremely hurt in the event that governments reacted to the show retreat within the same way.
Additionally, interdiction endeavors and universal collaboration may get less consideration, which would make it easier for traffickers to conduct their commerce.
Nations where noteworthy sums of opiates are snuck on commercial flights are expected to be most extremely affected.
Some of the time in colossal amounts, dispatches transport engineered drugs like methamphetamine in masked carry-on packs or rucksacks. Since that limits on discuss traveler activity are being actualized essentially all over, the utilize of commercial flying for the transportation of drugs can be totally hampered.
Regardless the disturbance of worldwide postal supply lines, there may be an upsurge within the trafficking of things by means of the mail and the dull web.
The long-term impacts of the retreat and related lockdowns may cause the pharmaceutical industry to be disturbed.
The destitute and powerless will be more slanted to utilize drugs hurtfully, create sedate utilize disarranges, and lock in in unlawful drug-related activities—whether generation or transportation—as a result of expanded unemployment and a need of openings.
Sedate trafficking organizations might benefit from this circumstance by making a difference out distraught bunches and enrolling unused individuals to swell their numbers.
These changes might effectively build up themselves as the modern typical in numerous places on the off chance that the government's capacity to reply is restricted.
Development and Complexity
Advertise development
Showcase development is to some degree clarified by populace development designs
Both the outright number of individuals utilizing drugs and the rate of the worldwide populace utilizing drugs have been rising.
In 2018, there were an estimated 0.269 billion drug users, which is 5.3% more than there were in 2009, when there were an estimated 0.210 billion users, or 4.8% of the world's population of people aged 15 to 64.
Sedate utilization has expanded altogether more rapidly in developing countries than in industrialized countries over the past 20 a long time.
This to some degree reflects the reality that worldwide populace development amid the time shifted between industrialized and creating nations, at 7% and 28%, separately, but it moreover reflects the more youthful populaces in poorer nations developing more rapidly.
Youthful individuals and young people account for the larger part of sedate clients.
The populace of this age bunch expanded by 16% within the creating world between 2000 and 2018, whereas it shrank by 10% within the created world.
One figure driving both the show and future pharmaceutical markets is urbanization
Urban zones are more likely than country ones to have a sedate issue, both in created and creating countries.
More than half of the world's populace presently lives in urban locales, up from 34% in 1960, and this colossal relocation from rustic to urban regions is to a great extent to fault for the common rise in sedate utilize.
Urbanization may play a critical part within the dynamics of sedate markets within the future, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more articulated.
Expanded riches is connected to an increment in medicate utilize, but the poorest individuals are most influenced by infection, medicate utilization is more common in created countries than in creating countries in general.
Substances like cocaine are more closely connected to more princely districts of the world.
Comparable to how it is among countries, medicate utilize is more common among the more rich areas of society.
However, individuals with lower financial position move to substance utilize issues at higher rates.
Moo pay and unsafe medicate utilize designs and conditions are related, agreeing to information from a little number of countries.
These patterns appear to be less predominant among financial classes with more prominent riches.
The risks for the foremost powerless people, such as medicate clients, are anticipated to be made more awful by the financial confinements forced by the around the world COVID-19 emergency.
For occasion, the scourge has tossed tens of millions of individuals out of work universally and changes within the labor advertise, such as rising unemployment, have already been related to expanded sedate utilize.
The pharma showcase seem develop encourage as a result of COVID-19, got to take chances and do illegal things.
Due to COVID-19-related imperatives, there may have been an upsurge in trafficking by ocean since it is less likely to be catching and can carry greater volumes of booty than arrive or discuss.
There have recently been rumors of cocaine shipments traveling directly by sea from South America to Europe.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but the market for potentially harmful new opioids is growing and becoming more complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control, and the non-medical use of drugs has also increased rapidly.
There are approximately 500 new active substances on the domestic market of Member States each year.
These days, stimulants make up the larger part of these, taken after by manufactured cannabinoid receptor agonists and a little number of opioids.
While the overall quantity of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
Opioid NPS accounted for only 2% of the total number of NPS identified in 2014, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new opioid psychoactive substances are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been shown to cause overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or in the manufacture of counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
Some evidence shows that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive substance stimulants in Europe: A study of the residues of abandoned syringes in six European cities found that many syringes are stained with new psychoactive substances that produce excitatory effects.
2 Modern psychoactive sedate utilize seem ended up broadly acknowledged in vulnerable communities
Seldom does a single lesson of NPS make a sizable advertise.
In any case, information from Europe shows that manufactured cannabinoids are a critical issue for socially prohibited bunches counting the destitute and detainees.
22 countries detailed on the utilization of NPS in detainment facilities, and the lion's share of them cited manufactured cannabinoids as a noteworthy impediment.
Forerunner chemical control compels drug makers to enhance, numerous substances that are as often as possible utilized as building squares for opiates counting amphetamine, methamphetamine, and "happiness" have been set beneath universal control.
Medicate makers and traffickers are continually investigating for substitutes, counting not as it were less entirely controlled drugs but moreover substances made intentioned to urge over existing directions, or "architect antecedents."
Medicate producers who depend on antecedent chemicals would certainly feel the impacts of prohibitive measures planning to halt the spread of COVID-19.
Information from Mexico infers that this is often as of now the case: in Walk 2020, Mexico and the Joined together States detailed cost rises for methamphetamine due to deficiencies of forerunners provided from East Asia.
The showcase is changing quickly
In Central Asia and the Russian Alliance, manufactured substances are taking the put of sedatives
From 2008 and 2018, it shows up that the sedative markets in Central Asia and the Russian League have moved.
Whereas less individuals are getting treatment for opioid utilization, the number of sedatives reallocated by Russian League specialists has diminished by generally 80%.
However it appears just like the doping industry is doing well.
There's confirmation that the Russian medicate advertise is right now overflowed with methamphetamine and a few cathinones, such as mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylvalerone.
More than multiplying in estimate over the course of two a long time, to 152 research facilities in 2018, Russian police detailed a considerable increment in later seizures of incognito research facilities creating a assortment of illegal opiates.
Showcase development for methamphetamine in Afghanistan and Iraq
Examinations of staff individuals in clinics, correctional facilities, and other teach as early as 2012 had demonstrated the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Along with "captagon" and tramadol, crystalline methamphetamine has developed as one of the foremost concerning drugs.
Medicate clients said that cannabis was more troublesome to get than "captagon" or methamphetamine in a 2015 ponder, which backed these discoveries.
The Board has voiced stress with respect to the importation of critical sums of pseudoephedrine arrangements, which are utilized as antecedents by methamphetamine research facilities, in light of the later disclosure of methamphetamine research facilities by Iraqi specialists.
The generation of methamphetamine in Afghanistan accepted to have begun around 2014.
Since at that point, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily expanding.
But compared to the earlier year, seizures within the to begin with half of 2019 come to 657kg, a noteworthy increment.
Considerable methamphetamine seizures in other countries that are assumed to have come from Afghanistan moreover suggest that make in that country is expanding rapidly.
Policy Changes and Trends
Most jurisdictions legalizing non-medical use of cannabis show a trend towards increased use of cannabis
Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of those jurisdictions, cannabis use had increased since legalization, although a similar trend had been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis had not been legalized.
In the first two states in the United States, Colorado and Washington, non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, particularly over the past month and on a daily or almost daily basis, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that since 2011, the use of marijuana in Uruguay has increased, with last month's usage almost doubling.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and regular use of marijuana.
Short-term data from Canada also indicate that use is increasing as the legal market expands between 2018 and 2019.
However, 40% of cannabis users in 2019 still obtained some products from illicit sources.
Is the legalization of cannabis the reason behind the plunge in global cannabis herb seizures?
Seizures of cannabis herb plunged to their least level universally in 2018 and had diminished by 84% over the past 10 a long time in North America.
Seizures, in the mean time, about multiplied in other parts of the world over the same time span. Concurring to the seizure slant, directions pointing at liberalizing the pot showcase were a major figure within the drop.
NPS control shows up to have a dissuasive impact, it is still challenging to assess the household control of NPS.
The predominance of NPS utilize changes among a few countries with particular NPS administrative systems.
With the sanctioning of household enactment, the utilize of NPS has diminished in different countries.
Both the legitimate and unlawful sedate markets harmed defenseless bunches, pharmaceutical opioids are for the most part accessible in high-income countries for the treatment of torment and palliative care, territorial incongruities exist within the conveyance of torment mitigation.
In 2018, high-income countries accounted for more than 90% of all medicine opioids that were accessible for therapeutic utilize.
There are 2% in Oceania, 50% in North America, and 40% in Europe.
The populace of these countries makes up around 12% of the complete world.
In spite of the fact that moo- and middle-income countries are thought to be domestic to 88% of the world's populace, they as it were utilize 10% of all pharmaceutical opioids.
Enactment, culture, healthcare frameworks, and endorsing hones are some of the numerous components that might make obstructions to getting to pharmaceutical opioids.
A substance utilize clutter is more likely to develop in those who are less well off, In 2018, 35,600 thousand individuals were influenced by a substance utilize issue.
Destitution, a need of instruction, and social prohibition may make substance utilize disarranges more likely to happen and decline their impacts. Thinks about in high-income countries have appeared that the likelihood of creating a sedate utilize clutter is additionally related with people's antagonistic financial directions, not as it were their status at a specific point in time.
In expansion to compounding financial drawback, sedate utilize clutters can too increment the chance of unemployment, destitution, and vagrancy, making a horrendous cycle of drawback. These discoveries might moreover be associated to the criminal equity system's stigmatizing hones and results.
Individuals in rustic zones, ladies, individuals of sexually assorted bunches, migrants, and individuals of ethnic minorities may too be excessively influenced by substance utilize clutters or have trouble getting to treatment offices.
The disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) marker, which calculates the a long time of sound life misplaced to incapacity and untimely passing, demonstrates that the affect of destructive sedate utilize on society as a entirety has gotten more regrettable over the past ten a long time.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of worldwide disability-adjusted life a long time credited to medicate utilization rose by 17%.
Untreated hepatitis C, which is predominant among infusing medicate clients, essentially expanded the number of DALYs (disease-associated mortality occasions) connected to liver cancer (up to 40%).
It is challenging to set up all causal joins between the utilize of psychoactive substances and savagery since the relationship between drugs and savagery is complex.
Inebriation may play a critical part in crime, agreeing to constrained information from around the world.
In any case, it appears that drinking contributes more to savage occasions than do drugs.
Sedate utilize may contribute to wrongdoing, but this interface may moreover be mostly clarified by a number of intervening variables, counting financial hardship and other sorts of difficulty brought on by individual hazard, family flow, and peer weight.
Viciousness and medicate trafficking are closely related on numerous levels.
On the off chance that steady criminal organizations are in put, large-scale organized wrongdoing, counting universal medicate trafficking, is likely to be carried out without viciousness.
Within the brief term, the nearness and concentrated of viciousness are less subordinate on the sum of trafficking than they are on certain changes that disturbed the pecking order of organized crime, such as shifts within the estimate of the dark showcase, high-profile criminals' downfall or imprisonment, and authorization activities that make one gather more helpless than another.
Recent trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, while opioids pose the greatest harm.
It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used cannabis, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked because of the low number of users.
Such substances were responsible for 66 percent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, and 50 percent of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost to disability or premature death due to drug use.
Synthetic opioid abuse worsens public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The two regions, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general drug use patterns, are struggling to combat an opioid crisis fueled by readily available and cheaply produced substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results in smaller numbers.
The variable potency of fentanyl on the black market for illicit drugs is one of the factors contributing to overdose deaths caused by fentanyl.
Tramadol's non-medical market has seen tremendous growth in West, Central, and North Africa.
Tramadol use disorders are being treated on a growing number of patients in the area.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol that was seized internationally peaked at more than 125 tons.
Global seizures, however, dropped to 32 tons in 2018 when India implemented a new rule governing tramadol.
The ease of production, low cost, and absence of international regulation of tramadol and several fentanyl analogs or their forerunners all contribute to the situation in both places.
The availability of these medications in both prescription and illegal markets, which makes it more challenging to identify and stop abuse, exacerbates the situation in both locations.
An increase in doping use
Cocaine and methamphetamine, which both have rising use in their key areas, dominate the stimulant market.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is widely utilized in Western Europe and North America.
In the same year, 27 million people took amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most popular ATS in North America and South-East Asia.
Most indicators show that methamphetamine usage has been rising in both regions for the past 20 years.
Cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist in some markets, occasionally substituting for one another, causing the use of one drug to climb while the usage of the other lowers, or occasionally both rising and falling to satisfy demand in the same market.
COVID-19 increases risk for injecting drug users
In 2018, it was projected that 11,300 thousand people used injectable drugs, and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are linked to injecting drug usage.
HIV infects more than 1 million drug injectors, while hepatitis C affects 5,500 thousand.
Half of the estimated 0.585 million drug-related deaths in 2017 were attributable to liver illness brought on by hepatitis C, which is largely untreated among injecting drug users.
5 Users may substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or combine opioids with synthetic narcotics as a result of opioid shortages brought on the COVID-19 regulations.
Some users switching to injections or injecting more regularly may lead to the emergence of more hazardous patterns of usage.

EU Summit Argues Over Refugee Policy, EU Official: Bottlenecks at Every Step of the Reception Process - China News Network
EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU official: bottlenecks at every step of reception process
[Global Times Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei in Belgium] According to Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, which makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The move by the EU was reportedly a response to the growing concern over illegal immigration in Europe, with the core issue now being that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.
Yet, the EU and member states have clashed over matters including how to pay for the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and thus speed up the construction process.
The European website Euractiv reported that EU officials admitted that there were bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and the limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities of member states could not prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries, leaving the EU's refugee reception system in a near "permanent crisis".
According to estimates from the European Commission, the Schengen member states of the EU received more than 920,000 asylum claims in 2017—a nearly 50% rise from the year before.
Almost 330,000 illicit entry were noted by the European Union last year.
In light of this, the summit also adopted the "principle" that member states of the EU may remove unlawful immigrants in accordance with a court ruling in another member state.
The article also stated that EU leaders decided to "expand the use of the notion of a safe state," which will allow the EU to create a standard list.

The United States escalates its "chip war" and hits the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com
Recently, the US "chip war" against China has shown signs of escalating - first, under US pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in China's sensitive technology industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the US has never ceased its efforts to suppress China's "core" development, precisely suppressing the supply chain of China's semiconductor industry on one hand, and building a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it's wooing South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China, or establishing a semiconductor industry chain "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the US is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintaining its advantageous position in the global chip industry.
However, the US's high-profile "chip tactics" against China also resulted in a "lose-lose" situation.
Recently, Lam Research, a well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of the ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been deeply affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-technology and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.
Using specialized division of labor, experts estimate that the complete production process for semiconductor devices requires crossing international borders more than 70 times and takes 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor sector has a solid base, its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in terms of modern manufacturing techniques, are relatively limited, and it mainly depends on East Asia.
It is difficult to modify the geographical distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries, even when the United States makes every effort to direct advanced chip production and the supply chain to the regional development of the "little circle" led by the United States.
The worldwide semiconductor industry has been seriously harmed by the United States' aggressive "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain.
The foundation of the global future industry is the chip, and the growth of the chip industry depends on the involvement of all nations in the globe.
The US passed 3 acts to reinforce its tech advantage: "Innovation and Competition Act," "American Competition Act of 2022," and "Chips and Science Act", It made chip manufacturers establish factories in the US and promoted US leadership in the industry.
The United States has temporarily hampered the growth of China's semiconductor industry and associated sectors while also reaping substantial rewards.
However, in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the US has forced China's chip industry to make constant advancements, depriving itself of the massive Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of US technology companies and harm the growth of the global chip industry.

The fitness industry should be free of the crisis of trust - China News Network
Another big gym "storm"?
Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of healthy members in well-known fitness facilities has attracted social attention.
Many of the members found that their stores did not operate normally after the Spring Festival, and rumors about the closure of the agency caused panic among the members, which led to the intervention of the public security and human society departments.
In the end, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil subsided.
Why is it that when individual fitness institutions temporarily close some of their branches due to operational issues, instead of calmly waiting for the problem to be resolved, many members' first reaction is "something is seriously wrong"?
Behind the turmoil of fitness club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt the prepaid model, "earning money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of its development.
By obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it seems like a cycle that can be repeated. However, it's actually robbing Peter to pay Paul, and cannot form a stable profit model.
Negative information in industries such as gym running away frequently spreads, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
Of course, gyms might be seen as a good business with "money potential" from the perspective of market prospects.
The fitness track has had its ups and downs, but capital has always been interested in it.
Many statistics demonstrate that the market is still growing and that consumption in the arts, sports, and other professions is becoming more and more popular.
With regard to the fitness market, there is a lot of room for growth given the steadily rising living standards of locals and the widespread acceptance of the value of a healthy lifestyle.
The requirement for the industry to focus on development quality increases as the situation improves.
Despite consumption recovery, some institutions were overly optimistic about the fitness market and invested all financing funds in new store construction. 5x5
The epidemic led to institutions withdrawing and business restructuring, big firms are restructuring and acquiring selectively, not a new opportunity.
But, the sector must alter the conventional model and its business strategy if it hopes to enter a positive feedback loop and follow a steady and long-term course.
We can only genuinely win the market and the future by working consistently and regaining the confidence and security of consumers.
The fitness business needs to settle down to maximize services and stabilize users with high-quality development, as opposed to opening additional locations to capture the market.
To keep users, it is first vital to rely on services.
The essence of the service sector, which includes the gyms, is to uphold "user orientation," pay special attention to customer needs, and improve service quality.
To enhance user experience, second, rely on digital transformation.
For instance, the current and widely used Internet gym model allows consumers to pay per view and select their own locations.
Body data and sports data can be used to address societal demands and create a seamless closed-loop service from online to offline at the same time.
Users are less concerned about "running away" from exercise facilities because there is no personal training promotion and no large annual card, and their sense of trust has also increased.
Also, we need to actively investigate other business forms.
Nowadays, watching sports is more like watching a scenario than just one service, fitness centers are anticipated to emerge as new points of access for consumers, sports gear and fitness equipment are examples of peripheral goods that could develop into new profit centers and give consumers more options.

Buy at a higher price, get a refund for the difference!
"Price Difference Compensation" Reappears in Nanjing Real Estate Market - China News Network
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporter discovered in an interview on the 10th that the "price guarantee agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A real estate project located in the Jiangbei New District claims "price difference compensation". If the discounts of other properties before the delivery are greater than the previous discounts, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are a lot of conditions in a "guaranteed price agreement".
The property located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. A prospective buyer, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.

Title: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - - Four Discussions to deeply understand General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
Xinhua News Agency Commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires overall consideration, systematic planning and overall promotion, and correctly handling a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up to the outside world.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to learn and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the Spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization, thoroughly and systematically expounded a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, and provided a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting modernization with Chinese characteristics involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It relates to the governance of the party, the country, and the military, domestic and foreign affairs, and defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, continuously achieving overall progress.
The top-level design requires a deep insight into the general trend of world development, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, an in-depth exploration of the laws of economic and social development, and a system of planning and policies that reflect the times, grasp the regularity, and are rich in creativity.
Promoting modernization in the Chinese style is an exploratory endeavor, with many unknown areas that need to be boldly explored in practice, and the development of the cause needs to be promoted through reform and innovation, and we must not stick to old ways or wait for opportunities to come.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party or a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we should strengthen the forward-looking nature of the strategy, foresee the future and lead it with a scientific strategy; we should strengthen the overall nature of the strategy, focus on solving major problems that affect the success or failure of the cause of the Party and the state, and affect the whole body at once; we should strengthen the stability of the strategy, and once the strategy is formed, we should adhere to it for a long time, grasp it to the end, and make good progress.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical and unified relationships of strategic and strategies, organically combine the principles of strategy and the flexibility of strategies, flexibly maneuverate, randomly strain, decide on the opportunity, and grasp strategic initiative to the strategic initiative in local conditions, move the situation, and follow the situation.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds tradition while pursuing innovation.
To handle the relationship between righteousness and innovation, we should not only guard the origin, root and soul of Chinese modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese modernization, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese modernization, but also place innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, respond to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively identify changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously build new momentum and new advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency.
As we advance Chinese-style modernization, we should not only strive to create higher efficiency than capitalism but also better safeguard social fairness, aiming to achieve a harmonious and mutually reinforcing relationship between efficiency and fairness.
We should handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness well, continuously realizing that development is for the people, relying on the people, and the benefits of development are shared by the people, ensuring that the achievements of modernization benefit all people more and in a fair manner.
Promoting China's style of modernization requires striking a balance between vitality and order, creating a society that is dynamic and vibrant while also maintaining stability and order.
We should coordinate well the two major tasks of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the capability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of the country's political power, institutional security, ideological security, and key areas of security.
We should consider security factors more in development, enhance national security capabilities through development, use the fruits of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a favorable security environment for economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, and achieving a virtuous interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To advance China's modernization in a Chinese way, we must adhere to our own path while broadening our global perspective, persist in opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of China's modernization.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, placing the development of our country and nation on the foundation of our own strength, and firmly grasp the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level opening-up, actively participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, broaden the development space of China's modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future through mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.
Adhering to the right path is crucial for achieving long-term success.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, and guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, let us grasp the laws, act diligently, fully demonstrate initiative, proactiveness, and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, and make vigorous efforts in the new journey of comprehensively building a socialist modernized country.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) The Biden administration on Friday (February 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of being involved in the spy balloon program.
The U.S. Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and a research institute were helping to modernize China’s military, especially aerospace programs, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist have difficulty obtaining technology exports from the United States.
The list, known as the "entity list", prevents companies from buying technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies listed on the blacklist are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group's 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Before that, the White House said it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger surveillance activities that threaten US national security.
The balloon incident triggered further tensions between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken cancelled his visit to China.
After the US shot down the balloon on February 4, the Chinese government lodged solemn representations with the US Embassy in China, criticizing the US for seriously impacting and damaging the efforts and process of the two sides to stabilize Sino-US relations.
From the existing wreckage evidence and information from China's military procurement platform, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon had a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was an approved supplier for the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding an incident where a Chinese unmanned civilian airship accidentally entered US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolution of the US Congress is purely political manipulation and hype.
China strongly expresses its dissatisfaction and firmly opposes such actions.
The Assistant Minister of the US Department of Commerce, Matthew Axelrod, said: "Today's action shows that we find out and prevent the common efforts of China from using spy balls and these balloons violate the United States and 40 Leading in multiple countries.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co said he was unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet made any comments on this information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) Several days have passed since the earthquake hit parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is becoming increasingly slim. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday made search and rescue personnel extremely gratified.
The family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the hard-hit town of Nurday in Gaziantep province, the Associated Press reported.
Rescuers first pulled the mother and daughter from a pile of rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, in harsh and cold weather conditions, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued.
"What day is it today?"
”--The teenager who was trapped under the ruins for 129 hours asked the rescuers who rescued him after being brought back to the ground.

Miraculous successful rescue cases brought a glimmer of hope to the originally hopeless rescue work, but at the same time, the number of casualties is also rising.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has resulted in over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, with an estimated death toll of over 3,500 people in neighboring Syria.
Despite experts stating that a person can potentially survive for over a week when trapped under rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly bleak.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
Meanwhile, the focus of the rescue efforts has shifted towards assisting the survivors who are in urgent need of help.
UN Official: "Once-in-a-Century" Disaster in the Region
UN Deputy Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, stated in a press conference held in Turkey that this earthquake is the "worst disaster in the region in a century."
He also praised Turkey's post-disaster response as "extraordinary."
He also told Reuters reporters that he hopes to provide aid to both the Syrian government-controlled areas and the areas controlled by opposition forces, but he mentioned that the situation is still unclear.
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in humanitarian aid to the earthquake-affected population in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced a $25 million allocation for humanitarian assistance in Turkey and Syria for disaster relief.

Google AI chatbot "answers wrong questions" parent company's share price evaporates by hundreds of billions of dollars
(Comprehensive report from the 11th)
Google's newly launched AI chatbot, Bard, had a poor start, "answering questions incorrectly" in promotional videos, causing Alphabet's stock price to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, and evaporating $110 billion in market value (approximately 476.5 billion ringgit), closing at $94.57 on Friday.

" Bard mentioned in the answer that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet.
However, according to data from NASA, the first photograph of an exoplanet outside our solar system was actually taken by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters reported that Alphabet shares plummeted after Bard answered wrongly.
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlighted the importance of rigorous testing processes" and stated that they would combine external feedback with their internal testing to ensure that Bard's responses "meet high standards in terms of quality, safety, and accurate information."

Singapore Tourism Board Director, Keith Tan, has stated that health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism offerings in the coming years.
The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.

The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Assistant Director of the International Division of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), Ko Suk Tan, said a survey by China Travel Platform ranked Singapore among the top three countries in the world in terms of safety index, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular among Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.60 million people from China traveled to Singapore for vacation each year
With China easing its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourist arrivals this year will recover to around 30% to 60% of the levels seen in 2019.
Ke Shudan pointed out that next, the tourism bureau will pay close attention to the further signals released by China's outbound travel policy in order to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to emerging trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that tourism will recover at a faster than expected pace as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession that affects public revenues, and as long as there are no new outbreaks of widespread deadly epidemics.

Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the middle of her parents, but also stood on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary parade of the Army Day on the following evening.
The North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" later released parade footage, revealing more scenes of deep father-daughter affection.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, the smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered to each other. Kim Ju-ae once held her father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media footage also showed that when Kim Ju-ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on the indoor sofa, she kept touching her father's face with her hand; when she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
However, the first lady, Ri Sol-ju, could only walk behind or sit aside the whole time, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Ju-ae first appeared in public on November 18 last year during the test launch of the Mars 17 missile, her exposure rate has been increasing over the past three months, and this is already her fifth appearance at an official event.
The official media of the DPRK referred to Kim Jong-ae with high honorific titles such as dearest son and honored son, and also broadcast a clip of Kim Jong-ae repeatedly shouting his pledge to uphold the white head bloodline while overlooking the parade march from the stands.
The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a sign that Kim Jong-un is putting his middle-school-aged daughter in the position of successor," but some believe that it is still too early to tell, as there are still various possibilities for Kim Jong-un to have a son at his side.
Chongyang Q&A | How do you view the US non-farm payrolls data for January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website
Q: How do you view the US non-farm payroll data for January and the outlook for investment?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm payrolls, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wages grew 4.4% year on year and 0.3% month on month, a slight slowdown.
In terms of overall figures, this data may be influenced by several one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers to work, revisions in survey statistical methods, and updates in seasonal adjustment factors. There could be subsequent revisions to the data (as seen in January 2022 when the initial figure of 504,000 new non-farm jobs was later revised down to 364,000 jobs). Therefore, the non-farm employment situation may not be as robust as the data initially suggests.
Structurally, the impact of job cuts in high-tech firms is still present, but relatively low; new jobs in high-touch services, such as leisure hotels and education and health care, have rebounded sharply, and data suggest that the service labor gap remains.
Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies, and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that it is difficult to improve the tension between supply and demand in the US job market without going through a recession.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old is already close to the pre-pandemic peak.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
The ongoing tightness in the US job market's supply and demand will be a prevailing characteristic of the US economy in 2023.
Considering the impending end of interest rate hikes and the continuous fluctuations in inflation expectations, we are not optimistic about the sustained decline in wage growth.
Prior to the release of this data, the US stock, bond, and currency markets had overly optimistic expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's path of interest rate hikes.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has continued to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, expecting not only an early halt to rate hikes, but also two year-end rate cuts.
In the case of tight labor market supply and demand, the impact of tightening policy is unknown, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance on rate hikes is relatively reasonable, the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of payroll growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of each CPI sub-leading indicators, since October the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline in the phase, the stubbornness of payroll growth will only form the bottom of future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, the market may enter a new round of gaming after the next release of inflation data.
Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led China's first listed clothing company to transform - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observation Network Reporter Zheng Huixin On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") released an obituary that Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.
In the 80s of last century, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory, and with the transfer, in 1989 Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Business Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand once reached as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just as the clothing business was booming, the Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and the possibility of Shanshan suits always leading the trend and becoming the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term is not great."
In 1999, Shanshan began researching corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai to figure out what to do with the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars."
In the end, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is "great health has a future".
After determining the strategic direction, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, a carbon research institute supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project with insufficient research funding. Therefore, Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere" project, engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial use of negative electrode materials domestically.
In 2001, Suning Corporation achieved large-scale production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres and began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in the domestic market.
Indeed, this made Suning Corporation the first Chinese production enterprise for lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials, thus achieving the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials in China.
With the rapid popularity of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugo began to develop gradually and In 2007, the lithium materials business was written into the main business of Sugo, and the revenue share of the garment business decreased year by year until 2013, the revenue of the lithium materials business of Sugo fully exceeded that of the garment business.
In February 2021, Sugo successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer enterprise Sugo Gold Optoelectronics, which is a relatively high technology field, and Sugo's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang has shared his insights on post-investment management, "The probability of success of Chinese private companies acquiring some international high-tech companies is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?
Because everyone will go to consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage, right, which is usually done an act ", however, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Sugo, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugo Gold Optoelectronics announced in public, Sugo as the majority shareholder of Sugo Gold, decided to implement a two-enterprise system, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Sugo enterprise people are not sent to Sugo Gold, to adopt the way of authorized operation, the original distribution system, corporate culture, the management model remains unchanged.
ICC Xinfern information released 2022 negative electrode data shows that the shipment of Sugo negative electrode in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, with a year-on-year increase of 100 % and a market share of 16 %, and the shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode material topped the list.
In the polarizer business, according to Yano Research, the company's Sugene Optoelectronics will reach a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
On the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Corporation revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, Shanshan Corporation share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan
On February 9, Suning Corporation stated on an interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite capacity was approximately 100,000 tons, and the graphite capacity of the Meishan project was still ramping up.
According to Wind Information, Zheng Yonggang is still listed as the Chairman and actual controller of Suning Corporation.
According to the SkyEye search, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1 % of the total equity of Sugo Holdings Co.
The general manager of Shanshan Co Ltd is Li Zhihua, was born in 1968,he has successively served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co Ltd, Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co Ltd, Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co Ltd, and deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co Ltd.
Suning Corporation stated on February 10 on the investor interaction platform that there is no familial relationship between the senior management personnel and the actual controller of the company.
"Fund E-account" is here: CSRC authorizes development, all funds under investor's name can be consolidated and queried - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan: Is it difficult to consolidate account information due to the complex channels of fund purchase?
Always forgetting about the "small treasury"?
The issues faced by fund investors are about to be resolved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced that the "Fund E-account" app has been made available on various mobile app stores and is undergoing public trial operation.
According to reports, the "Fund E Account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" query service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve industry service pain points such as forgetting accounts and cumbersome inquiries for small and medium investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, managing approximately 26 trillion yuan in funds; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
Each share registration institution has its own independent account system, and there is a lack of industry-wide unified channels for querying information.
According to industry sources, by the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the people in the country invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to check their purchases through different sales institutions, but through "Fund E Account", they can check their purchases from all sales channels and see their fund holdings at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to relevant documents, the "Fund E-account" app is a mobile application developed and constructed by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (ChinaClear) with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
Through "Fund E Account", investors can easily and quickly grasp their holdings of OTC shares of each fund manager's public fund products purchased through various sales channels in the market, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, investors can use the "Fund E-account" app to access various information, including their fund account information opened with fund management companies across the entire market, transaction account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and holdings of off-exchange shares of publicly offered securities investment funds, as well as collective asset management plans that are not limited to 200 investors and managed by securities firms.
Liu Yichan, business leader of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the Economic Observer that investors can get one-stop information about all their OTC public fund holdings through the "Fund E Account" app, which helps them find their "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it realizes comprehensive fund investment information collection for customers, which helps them grasp their investment situation more timely, accurately and completely, so that they can better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and better plan their financial arrangements.
How do I register to use it?
The reporter noted that, at present, the "fund E account" APP has been in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and other cell phone application store shelves, but APP is still in the public trial stage, registration needs to fill in the invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the funds held to obtain.
A medium to large public fund customer service staff in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the Economic Observer reporter, and told the reporter, "APP trial run phase, China Settlement provides each fund manager a certain number of invitation codes, when investors call over to get, we will provide.
After the trial run is over, the invitation code will not be used when opening user registration.
"
According to the official website of the Securities and Futures Commission, the reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the documents related to the download and instruction of "fund E account", the whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the "assets" fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will be displayed in the binding option list (account binding is possible), and you can watch it directly after the binding is completed The total assets of the invested fund can be found and the query function can be used.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides querying services for investors and does not facilitate the buying or selling of funds.
The data displayed on the "Fund E-account" is typically three trading days prior to the date (T-day) of the user's query.
For example, if you open the "Fund E-account" on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and net asset values displayed on the asset page will correspond to the date three trading days prior to that date, which is February 7.

The US, Japan, and the Philippines reach a defense consensus against the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached consensus on opposing the Chinese Communist Party's encroachment on the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement saying that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the Chinese Communist Party's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida hoped to use the meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January and was awarded a $20 billion deal.
However, after this, not only did Sino-Philippine relations not improve, but they declined.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
One of the new additions is 300 kilometers from Taiwan and the closest location to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
The Japanese media now believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, as well as the Philippines, have formed an axis with the United States to build an "arc against the Chinese Communist Party" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Xia Liyan, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, conveyed Song Tao's words during his visit: Welcome to Lvying to visit Lu under the 92nd Consensus
The Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of Taiwan, Xia Liyan, met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China, Song Tao, and the Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning, during his visit to China.
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Government Foundation, an official organ of the Kuomintang, spoke positively of Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that China welcomes Green Campers to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the 1992 Consensus and oppose Taiwan independence.
The Kuomintang considered it a novelty.
The news on the day Xia Liyan met Song Tao earlier did not mention this statement.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying its refusal to accept the "1992 Consensus" in recent days.
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit China. During their stay in Beijing, they met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
During his meeting with Song Tao, Xia Liyan discussed that the political foundation of the KMT and the CCP is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's National Policy Foundation, stated in the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he had attended.
In recent video conferences with mainland scholars, and in this discussion, there was no talk of military unification or the "Anti-Secession Law." Instead, the focus was on resuming exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides of the strait are fighting fiercely, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Due to the lack of mutual trust between the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Communist Party of China (CPC), Zhao Chunshan stated that the CPC still wishes to work for the benefit of the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want to worsen cross-strait relations.
According to Zhao Chunshan also said that Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao to say "they (Taiwan farmers and fishermen) put forward the request, you must implement", if the overall solution can not be adopted, but also to adopt a case-by-case approach.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members discussed the daily military provocations by Chinese aircraft and warships near Taiwan, the agricultural and fishing issues in certain counties and cities of Taiwan, or if these topics were raised by journalists from the Central News Agency during the interviews.
French trade unions mobilize again to protest against the government's retirement reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's pension reform draft, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social unrest against the government's draft reform of the pension system.
And how many people respond to the rally call could influence the trade union's next course of action.
This is the fourth time in a month that eight major French trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and the first time this protest has scheduled a rally on a Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, they do not have to choose between participating in a protest or a wage strike, so trade unions hope that today's rally will attract more people.
Neither the unions of the bus system, the subway nor the public railway company called for a strike today, and the bus system should be functional, with citizens able to travel to the meeting place, and in areas where schools begin winter break, people can start their holidays normally.
The unions are hoping for more than a million people to take part in today's rally, while the police are expecting nationwide attendance of between 600,000 and 800,000, and 90,000 to 120,000 in the Paris metropolitan area.
Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, polls have shown that most French do not support measures to postpone the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, but the number of people who actually took to the streets to participate in the march has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 rallied between 1.27 million to 2.5 million people nationwide.
The demonstration on this Tuesday, February 7, saw a decrease in the number of participants, ranging from 757,000 to 2 million people nationwide.
The retirement pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the ones led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, which have slowed down the deliberation process significantly.
The debates between the ruling party and the opposition have become increasingly fierce and contentious.
A member of parliament from the radical left-wing party France Unbowed recently transmitted a picture of himself on social media with a balloon with the head of the labor minister on his foot, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The President of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day suspension for the member of parliament, effectively barring them from participating in parliamentary activities, as a punishment for their conduct.
Despite the widespread social unrest triggered by this reform proposal, which has been the largest in over two decades in France, the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft without making any significant concessions thus far.
The unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and are planning to organize demonstrations on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion.
China encourages increasing birth rates, urging high-quality sperm donations in universities.
On the 9th, the Human Sperm Bank in Yunnan Province, China, issued a promotion seeking individuals with a college degree or above, or current students, to donate sperm. It stated that individuals who successfully donate sperm 8 to 12 times would receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message quickly became popular on Weibo and sparked similar initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing.
According to a report by Liberty Times, China is encouraging college students to donate sperm.
Among all the universities where sperm donation takes place, Beijing has the highest requirements. In addition to education, they also require a height of over 170 cm, regular facial features, no obvious hair loss, and nearsightedness not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of andrological physical examination worth 1,000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome testing, most people have never done it, which is of great significance to understand their fertility status."
Sperm donors are required to be at least 165 centimeters tall, have a college degree or above, or be enrolled in a college, and be free of color blindness, color deficiency, genetic diseases such as Hepatitis B, and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China's Tianmu News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank of Shaanxi Province printed a poster with the slogan "Paid Sperm Donation, Unlimited Glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages and "let love pass on".
In Shaanxi province, the price is higher than in Yunnan, with qualified individuals receiving 300 RMB in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of 5000 RMB.
As of now, it is known that Beijing offers the highest compensation, with a maximum subsidy of RMB 5150.
East Germany's last communist chancellor dies today
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95."
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had divided East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Hans Modrow expressed his commitment to helping transform East Germany into a democratic country.
At the time, Communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
As a result of the election, he ceased to be Prime Minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of attempting to delay the political changes and reunification scheduled for October 1990.
He also faced criticism for attempting to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to prison.
There have been claims that these accusations were politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a Member of the European Parliament.
Modrow considered himself as a reformer and aimed to bring about change within the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want a return to the old East Germany but believed that the achievements of East Germany should be acknowledged.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return but said it should be recognized for its achievements.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in the Youth Fire Brigade and, near the end of the conflict, became a member of the Nazi militia Volkssturm, which enlisted men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a committed communist.
In 1949, the year the GDR was founded, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic and continued his studies in social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young East Germans joined, and rose through the ranks of the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) to become president of the Dresden Regional Party from 1973 to 1989.
Indeed, Modrow served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, assuming the highest national position.
Iran marks anniversary of revolution Hackers supporting protests hack president's televised speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ebrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The president's live TV speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers appeared on the screen. Their name was “Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)”.
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic" during the interruption.
According to a Reuters report today, Iran commemorated the anniversary of the revolution, and hackers interrupted coverage on national television.
As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, the hardline government of Raisi faces the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their resignation. However, Raisi still calls for the "deceived youth" to repent so they can receive the pardon of Iran's supreme leader.
Protests continue to sweep across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September during her detention by the country's moral police.
Iran's security forces have carried out deadly repression against protests, which is one of the strongest challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2500-year-old monarchy.
As part of an amnesty marking the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released jailed dissidents Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on Friday, who were on hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
Human rights group HRANA reported that 528 protesters had been killed as of Friday, including 71 minors.
Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.
It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters have been arrested.
For the past few weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for a vote during Saturday's rally to demonstrate opposition to the protest activities and show support for the government.
On Friday night, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media displayed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!). "
However, many could also be heard at the rally shouting "Death to the dictator!
" and "Death to the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television broadcasted live footage of official gatherings held in various states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebration, there were displays of domestically produced ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment.
President Laisi's speech was frequently interrupted by chants of "Death to America," which is a common slogan heard during state gatherings.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel" during the event.
According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been imprisoned in Iran since 2019, is one of the seven French nationals detained in Iran, which has been a factor contributing to the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
Later, she was placed under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
Just a week before his release, supporters had warned that Mesami was at risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday and called for the restoration of her freedom, including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes.

The balloon incident has brightened America's eyes?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to The Wall Street Journal's report today, following the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials have stated that the aforementioned balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China, and they will seek more political support to strengthen technology protection in the United States.
The United States said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official now at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"This undoubtedly added fuel to the fire, supporting the views of the hardliners towards China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader action to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners."
U.S officials said they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the above balloon incident and that international coordination is essential to address the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, newly established House of Representatives Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Communist Party of China may put pressure on the United States to take tougher measures to slow China's development.
She stated that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to demand a tougher stance, and this could in turn force the White House to adopt more aggressive policies.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing for an expansion of the regulatory scope to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government has also been developing a foreign investment review program to assess whether US investments overseas pose potential national security threats originating from China.
Analysts suggest that the White House may face calls to expedite the rollout of the program.
Turkey-Syria Earthquake Relief Night and Day
Since the strong earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been tirelessly working day and night amidst the debris of thousands of collapsed buildings, striving to rescue survivors trapped under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often appeal for silence, as they desperately try to listen for any signs of life amidst the crumbling concrete piles.
According to a recent report by Reuters, two more women have been rescued after surviving for several days in the wreckage of the earthquake.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey stands at 20,665 people, while in Syria, it has surpassed 3,500 people.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
The strong earthquake that occurred in northwestern Turkey in 1999 resulted in the death of over 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building by rescue workers in Turkey after being trapped for 122 hours, following the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years.
Another injured 55-year-old man has been identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the wreckage of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often appeal for silence as they strive to listen for any signs of life amidst the crumbling concrete rubble.
In the Samandag area of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under a concrete slab, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the debris and pulled out a 10-day-old newborn baby.
With wide-open eyes, the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to a field hospital for medical attention.
Video footage shows that the paramedics also carried away his mother, who appeared dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious and alert.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that in the past 24 hours, 67 people have been rescued from the rubble, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel have been deployed in the affected areas.
About 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, he said, while 105 million people have been rendered homeless by the quake and are huddled in temporary shelters.
Due to the lack of food for many people in harsh winter conditions, there is an increasing number of public questioning regarding the response of the two countries' leaders to the disaster.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad went to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, according to official Syrian media, it was reported that this was his first trip to the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme (WFP) stated that due to the complexities caused by the ongoing conflict, its stocks are running dangerously low in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adıyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by the disaster.
According to Reuters, the anger over the delay in providing assistance and initiating rescue operations could potentially impact the elections. The handling of the disaster and the government's response will likely be a significant factor for voters to consider when making their decisions
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdogan's two decades in power.
Erdogan called for unity and denounced what he called "a negative campaign for political gain.
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, has criticized the government's response to the earthquake.
The criticism states that "the earthquake is significant, but what is even more serious than the earthquake itself is the lack of coordination, planning, and incompetence.

Hanoi, Vietnam News Agency - A special correspondent reports that during his visit to Brunei Darussalam, on the morning of February 11, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as "University of Brunei").
The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the local university rankings.
Brunei University symbolizes the cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei in the field of education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei officially established a partnership with FPT University in Vietnam, with the main area of cooperation being English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei has also incorporated Vietnamese into its curriculum.
During a visit to the University of Brunei, the Prime Minister of the Vietnamese Government, Fan Mingzheng, and his wife had an exchange with the students of the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is pleased that an increasing number of foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, and is actively contributing to promoting the unique culture and customs of Vietnam to the world.
The Prime minister of the Government, Fan Mingzheng, expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teachers at the University of Brunei will become stronger and stronger; the students in the Vietnamese language class will become more and more interested in Vietnamese, study hard, and be able to use fluent Vietnamese as soon as possible, and become the messenger of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang city via video, understanding their learning situation, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh believes that the cooperation between Vietnam's FPT University and the University of Brunei, especially the FPT-UBD Global Centre, is a vivid symbol of the educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
He also expressed his hope for the students at the center to make greater progress in their studies and contribute actively to the friendly cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
During the discussion with the Minister of Education and the head of Brunei University, Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet highly appreciated the achievements of the two countries in education cooperation, including the cooperation between FPT University and Brunei University and the initiative to include Vietnamese language in the curriculum of Brunei University.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh expressed his hope that the University of Brunei Darussalam will continue to prioritize the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet also highly appreciated the positive results of the cooperation between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding on education cooperation signed in April 2014, and suggested Brunei to continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as Global Discovery Programme and Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet highly appreciated the establishment of the University of Brunei in Vietnam as its first branch in Southeast Asia; believed in the growing scale of the University's development in the region and the world; and further expanded the partnership with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet and his wife planted a memorial tree on the campus of the University of Brunei and left a message in the memorial book.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet wished the University of Brunei to move forward and contribute more and more to the education of Brunei, and to develop deeper and wider cooperation with various educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

What exactly was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
Confusion and speculation abound
The US military once again used its most advanced stealth fighter jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, US, on Friday afternoon (February 10).
Ten miles off Alaska's coast, it was shot down.
This was the second time the United States had shot down an aerial object in less than a week.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted in US airspace for days before it was destroyed near the US coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said the second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 metres (40,000 ft), about the size of a small car, and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also considered that there was currently no indication that the object was manipulable.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications for the White House's National Security Council, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the object flying at high altitude was unclear, it "poses a legitimate threat to the safety of civil aircraft."
Kirby stated that the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
"The most accurate description we can currently provide is what we refer to as a 'object'," said Bryant.
Before deciding to send the object down, President Biden followed the Pentagon's counsel, a choice he made "very carefully," according to Bryant.
This object's official US description can be summed up roughly as follows: The flying height is around 10,000 meters, the size is comparable to a compact automobile, there is no joystick, and there is no suspension system.
However, at this time, the information does not adequately address fundamental queries such what the object is, to which nation it belongs, and what function it serves.
Many analyses and conjectures on the Internet at the moment suggest that this could be another Chinese balloon.
It might have originated in China, just like the spy balloon that violated American airspace and the Chinese balloon that flew across Latin America and carried out some sort of operation elsewhere.
This "object" in Alaska has also been linked by some individuals to a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).
Former US Representative Peter Meijer tweeted on Friday, "Wish this 'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO," according to a US Newsweek story.
Major remarked, "although it would be ironic to mistake an extraterrestrial spacecraft for a weather balloon, it would not be worth starting an interstellar war."
The item in Alaska had been shot down, Bryant had just confirmed before Major's tweet.
According to Newsweek, Major was not the only person who thinks the object was a UFO.
Rep Tim Burchett a Republican from Tennessee, condemned the administration's cover-up last month and demanded that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) disclose a report on "unidentified flying objects."
I find Amazon's customer service attitude to be unbelievable
I guess not many people will read this, but I still want to say a little bit.
It was a zipped hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short sleeve that I was given.
As soon as I received the clothes, I got in touch with Amazon customer service. It was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock at the time. I asked for a replacement. The customer service said they would fix it, then I immediately saw that the product name had changed to short sleeve. It turned out that the link I had bought was removed from the shelves.
The customer service then informed the consumer to either keep the items and get a specified amount of compensation, or return the things.
Does Amazon handle it in this manner?
It's really unbelievable. The wrong clothing itself wasn't my problem. As a consumer, I asked for the products I should get, and I didn't make any exaggerated claims, but Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long comment, and I hope it's not my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves
The sleeves of the jacket are usually longer than the sleeves of the jacket, but they are usually 1-2 cm long, and the arm should naturally hang in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of the jacket are covered with fingers.
Clothing is easy to buy and easy to return.
But when will the money be returned?
The clothes were well made, but due to the small size, I had to return them. However, it's been over a week since I returned them and I still haven't received a refund?
Also, the buyer must contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very honest. This is the worst shopping since buying an Amazon item!
But the store is still good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express is really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. This kind of partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!
more suitable for young people
99 Seconds.
The craftsmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, they are soft and of moderate thickness, and do not have a kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim fit, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, with a flat waist circumference of 2.5 feet, maximum stretch size of 4 feet, is a bit tight around the waist for someone weighing 1.79/80 kilograms.
It seems there is no elastic waistband, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waist.
In addition, wearing it so close to your body is uncomfortable.
Very good, the color is not very bright.
I just bought it and it went up by more than 200. That's what's going on.
This was the first time Amazon used the cooperative courier service, Tian Tian Express, which was terrible. The first time they attempted delivery, I wasn't home. I then proactively arranged two delivery times with the courier, but they didn't deliver either time and eventually returned my package. This damn courier has no integrity at all. I strongly suggest not using Tian Tian Express anymore.
This time, a t-shirt was also returned to me, and if I were to buy it again, the price has increased by more than a hundred yuan.
Such products should not appear on Amazon's self-operated platform.
The product was purchased on sale, the price was not low, and the reviews also indicated that it was a very good product.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was worn in a large area, and there was wear in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old product. Later, the picture above showed that it was old.
I requested a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was due to transportation after seeing the picture. Isn't that a baseless claim?
How does anything get worn down inside?
There are only two possibilities, either it's a substandard or used product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no proof that I did not damage the item, but considering my track record of Amazon purchases, I believe that such items shouldn't be included in Amazon's self-operated products, Customers choose to trust Amazon's self-operated products, customer win, we win, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2s have appeared, I don't know how to deal with it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often showed red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, right? This doesn't quite match what the Amazon website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years, right? I can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website, and now I don't know what to do?
Okay
The first purchase was faulty.
It doesn't seem brand-new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the body was also broken.
And the screen is always white.
It got better after changing it.
Although the viewing angle is not very wide, the replacement is extremely quick, and it is a little hazy at night; it is sufficient for everyday home use.
The disadvantage is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I bought a mobile phone from Amazon before.
There would usually be a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but this time there wasn't. When buying a phone, there would also be a sticker-like seal that could be attached to the warranty card, but this time there wasn't.
I don't know if it's because things are cheap, so I'm confused.
Awaiting response from the supplier
The packaging had no markings, so I called the supplier directly. They said that the lack of markings indicated that it was genuine, and if I had doubts, I could send a sample to Johnson & Johnson for verification. They also left their license plate number and phone number, promising to send a text message to notify me that my information had been entered into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their official website, but I haven't received a text message yet?
I received the engine oil in the morning and replaced it in the afternoon.
Second acquisition.
Amazon's self-operated products are very reliable.
It is said that the oil is clean and good.
Because it was the second purchase.
So it's still very reassuring.
The delivery was fast, the packaging had no faults, and after using this oil, the engine noise noticeably decreased.
The price/performance ratio is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic motor oil under 200.
The winner is the one who has the most points, the winner is the one who has the most points, and the winner is the one who has the most points.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (delivering an 8cm caterpillar instead of an 8c caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c).
Admitting the mistake, but always refuting, always emphasizing that the goods are third parties and cannot bind the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
When I originally purchased, the size options on the page were 7c, 8, 9c. I thought this was a trap, so I called Amazon's Chinese customer service and was clearly told that 8 meant 8c. However, when the product arrived back in China, I found out it was only 8cm. I believe this was a trap deliberately set to scam Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, this option is no longer available on the page.
Chinese customer service: We are very sorry for your loss. We give you two options:
1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the product, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.
(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which counts as 200rmb, choose 1, I don’t have shoes, and the loss is 200 yuan.
Choice 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2,000 yen, and the final loss was 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I replied an email, saying that I would not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service. It is over.
I said, the purchase page is about confusing options like 7c, 8, and 9c, and the Chinese customer service assistant said the Japanese code would not have a c like that, like 140, but have you seen other caterpillar pages?
Both have a mixed label scenario with American and Japanese codes.
In addition, why do you place 8 cm between 7 cm and 9 cm when it is definitely the smallest size.
Chinese customer service: We offer Chinese service, but since we are unsure whether you'll be sending it back to your own nation, we are unable to cover your shipping expenses.
This reasoning baffles me once more, I need Chinese customer service despite being Japanese, Customer service from Chinese speakers in Japan is unnecessary, the ability to place international long-distance calls is not a talent that visitors to Japan possess, who needs to call, This then becomes a question, nothing more than regular purchasing for me, Amazon is buying Chinese phones from other countries.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service simply more practical for those of us who shop from abroad?
This purchase is not very satisfactory
This is the second time I bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers made of paper imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with the first purchase experience. The baby used them all night One diaper can indeed satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L-size diapers, and there are 2 packs in a box packed separately. After opening it, I feel that the paper is relatively loose, which is obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for my baby, it is OK. There is no leakage of urine and there is no sign of rash.
However, after starting the second pack of diapers, a rash immediately appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs and has not yet faded.
The 2 products in 1 box might not be of the same quality, in my opinion.
I probably won't continue to buy in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of the package
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been shopping online for a long time. There are no protective measures at all, such as cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer materials, etc., nothing.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft rubber boxes inside were packaged in such a way that the card boxes were squashed and deformed.
I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed. I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather pay half more domestically for some assurance.
Moreover, regarding the issue of product packaging, I saw comments from as early as 2016, and now in 2019, it's still the same.
It shows that Amazon does not pay attention to service feedback at all, and it is far behind domestic JD.com and Tmall.
Good-looking, but a little bit of a pity
I really like the color of the whole cup. It's orange red. Even though I have a baby boy, I still think the orange red with yellow is very bright.
It was smaller than I thought, but it was supposed to be brought out, so it was acceptable.
I brought it home to try last night, and after opening the bottle cap, I found that the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertically straight, my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this could be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight, large capacity
I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, as I'm not sure what to put in them.
After purchasing, I found another similar brand on the overseas shopping platform, Amazon, for less than two hundred yuan.
Fake goods, extremely fake.
I can't believe Amazon sells counterfeit goods.
The customer service said that because I used it, I couldn't return it. How would I know it was a fake if I didn't use it?
Because of trust, there is sadness. After all, it's a facial product. It's better to buy it in a physical store, even if it's a bit more expensive.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already reported it to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.
Is it damaged?
Counterfeit goods?
Simply put, tragedy.
When I used the second piece, I chose the one for fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. But when I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it at all. The smell was very strong, indescribable, and it made me cough immediately. My eyes were also very painful and teary, so I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I don't believe it but I opened another piece of the same type, it doesn't smell as bad and I'm putting it on now.
It reminded me a bit of the smell of cheap perm solution in a hair salon.
It's unimaginable. Is it really that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided from now on?
Profiteers
When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page said that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at the time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of web pages when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for promotions you have run yourself. Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.
Feelings after use
This is my first time shopping on Amazon, and I have several impressions to share. Let's start with my feelings after using the product. Firstly, it is indeed painless and doesn't have any irritating smell. Overall, it's pretty good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it can be wiped off easily, leaving only a small amount of hair residue on the surface, which is not noticeable unless you look closely. So overall, it's pretty good. As for the future, I need to continue observing and using it to know more.
Anyway, I think this is really good.
Second, I placed an order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th. A total of 15 days is half a month. Amazon's delivery staff has a good service attitude.
Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday and wait for 2 days, it's nearly 12 yuan cheaper, which means I bought it for more than 170 (plus shipping).
I had been looking at the price for more than 10 days, and it's been like that, no big fluctuations.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese label, with granules, definitely repurchase!
There are granules in the paste, the refreshing feeling is just right, and the teeth are smooth after use. It is much better than a second-hand product. It says that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels. I don't know where they are wholesaled from.
From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand Dong again.
Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on the Amazon app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!
Over the years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!
Garbage Excellence does not consider customer needs. When placing an order, the special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.
Due to having an elderly person at home who is bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages in the evening.
Surprisingly, they delivered it directly to the door at noon without giving any prior notice by phone.
If the delivery time is at the whim of your couriers, why bother pretending to let customers choose a time?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then simply stop doing e-commerce!
Making an elderly person with three wounds get out of bed to answer the door and pay for a delivery is outrageous!
There is a telephone number on the order!
From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation!
The so-called customer service for complaints on the Excellence website is just a bunch of outsiders pretending, dealing with your complaints and then giving you a so-called reply.
There will be no modification or payment!
Similar issues have occurred before, and I was able to tolerate them, such as an incorrect delivery date, but this time it is too much for me to handle!
You shipped the book to the client while still not paying attention to the fact that the back cover and front cover of the new book were sideways when it came after the pre-sale?
No one will contact you if you leave a negative comment.
Over the years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!
No more money will be spent on Excellence.
The image quality is simply unacceptable.
For a book titled "Ancient Map Collection", the choice, layout, and printing of the images are simply unacceptable, with some images even pixelated to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval documents left by the ancestors in the catalog!
(Besides, many pictures can be obtained from related industry resources with clear original documents). What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?
I regret such an attitude towards scholarship.
The text is not evaluated, and each party has its own way of distinguishing it.
Overall 2 stars.
When I read this book in my second year of high school, I was just reading it out of boredom. I didn't think I would get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian have never been that appealing to me.
Subsequently...it fell into the pit.
Following the plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even if there were intrigues between guilds, it was not heavy because it was often made light-hearted by Ye.
As for the competition part, it conveyed a bit of the bittersweet feeling of the changing times and the transition from old to new (perhaps I'm just sentimental).
Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place, and the characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place at the right time, such as when they are in the right place at the right time, or when they are in the wrong place at the right time, such as when they are in the wrong place.
And in the relationship line, full-time also does not have the general net article is criticized by the harem beautiful thirty million either beautiful or corrupt fault, the full text of all the people's feelings, all have a common place is that they love the glory of the game, and most of them want to hallow the victory.
There is no big conspiracy, and everyone looks so simple and cute.
There might not be any unpleasant full-time jobs for this reason.
This is due in large part to full-time IPs.
Full-time is still a terrific book even when the cultural phenomena of internet writing is disregarded.
He will essentially give a tiny touch and some hot blood.
In April of this year, animation will be full-time.
In fact, I've wanted to acquire this collection of books for a while, but I've put it off since my wallet isn't thick enough, then, when I went to purchase it, I discovered that there were many fakes on tb, in truth, the cover image was just released in a different version by the full-time, I visited Amazon and ordered a set all at once because I personally really enjoy it but still intend to purchase the older version first.
Let's now briefly discuss the state of the products.
●The fourth book doesn't have a plastic cover, but it is brand-new.
●The seventeenth book is still in its plastic packaging, but it has been opened, its texture is also quite odd, and it is not as hard as the others.
●The 23rd book is identical to the 17th book, however, it is older and harsher than the 17th book.
●Individual novels are published by various companies, in contrast to the others, it appears that the 23rd and 17th are published by the same company.
●Overall, I'm happy with the outcome, a sizable box contains 24 books, and I am pleased with my purchase.

When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Missing Piece" but it turned out that there are a lot of words!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book for my kids. It's a little lion that can shoot, a little lion that loves fruit juice and gummies.
When I saw the story of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urban people are a bit unreceptive to this arrangement of being eaten by animals.
Seeing the end, this little lion who has succeeded in human society has lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete human being.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I didn't know where he had gone.
Maybe many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the memory of the grown-up children, and if she is reminded of it inadvertently one day, it may touch or inspire her.
Cost-effective collection of works
I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I've bought quite a few of their books because they are so impressive, both in terms of the topics they choose and the production itself.
There have been three versions of this work, the largest of which is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, similar to the complete works of Michelangelo; the medium version is approximately 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a two-volume book box.
It was also acceptable, as it was cheaper and more than 700 pages split into two, which could be easily read as a paperback edition; secondly, unlike the complete Michelangelo collection, which was dominated by paintings, the manuscript in black and white by Leonardo da Vinci was the majority, and the edition was the best value for money as an appreciation of the paintings and manuscripts for budget-constrained, non-art readers.
The commentary on the painting section is excellent, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but due to either printing or book size issues, some shadow parts are too dark to see the details, which is a bit regrettable.
In contrast to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.
The former is already a genius, while the latter is so extensive and accomplished that it is not enough to describe as a genius.
You will be rendered absolutely dumbfounded after reading the manuscripts if you could only comprehend half of Da Vinci from the artwork before.
Trash, who bought who regrets!
I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely rubbish. It's a waste of money. Give me a reason!
1. When the time is not right, it suddenly becomes 1 January, and the time goes to zero.
2. Inferior belts, none of which are silicone, bring wrist allergy blistering.
3. I often can't connect to my phone.
The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection is not displayed and the time is 0.
6. It's not waterproof.
7. Others.
Logistics is too slow
It was supposed to arrive on October 16th, but I only received it on the 21st. Bad review!
The express delivery is too bad, and shopping on Amazon is already slow, but I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfactory
Initially, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine. There was an airbag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website. The shutter count was zero, and the rest would have to be tested over time.
The delivery speed was quite fast, but I have to complain about the courier. He left the valuable item at the door and left quickly. I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, which left me speechless.
The merchant has considered the customer's needs before shipping :)
The merchant was quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer's needs.
The delivery is also fast.
The diamond film fits quite well and is effective.
The battery cannot be fully charged.
The machine is indeed good, but I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time, the charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, I can't find an official feedback channel on Amazon, so I can only provide feedback in the product reviews.
1. On March 29, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it shows that it will be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website (because it has not yet been released);
2. The price of the book's electronic version on Amazon has been lowered to 18 yuan, and the content of the book that was pushed to the device on March 31 is blank;
3. I have tried several times over the past two days to remove the downloaded blank book from the device and synchronize it again, but I am unable to download "The Essence of Business" in its entirety, however, I can see that the book can be previewed on Amazon's official website.
So, I have a few thoughts.
The issue of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books of actual content, rather than always downloading "coming soon".
I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it gets postponed, downloading an empty book seems very complicated.
3. I hope that Amazon will provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there will be a place to give feedback (work orders and online customer service are both acceptable, and you can refer to Microsoft’s official mall for how to do it. of)
Not really recommended reading
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it and write something about it from memory.
This book is more of a collection of fragments about love in life than it is a compilation of short stories.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, like that of plain water, with the pursuit of simplicity in word choice and sentence construction taken to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a brief sketch of ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally, they were collected together and titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."
I consider the title of this anthology of novels to be a type of performance art, the author aims to convey that love is more than only the emotions experienced on stage, the rocks and dry sea in urban tales, and the bond that binds you and I together, not only should the aforementioned not be seen as a representation of love, but also of a life that is dull day in and day out, as plain as water, with a loss of life, denial of reality, and uncertainty about the future.
While you read this book, images of the quarreling couples around you, the uninteresting marriages of individuals you know, and the unsatisfying relationships can be running through your head.
Since the writing and plot of this book are dull from an artistic standpoint, I do not advocate reading it, unless your life is difficult or sweet, like living in a candy castle, you will feel uncomfortable when you are forced to read it, not strange and dull.
From a depth of thought perspective, the everyday plot does not dazzle or expand one's thinking and perspective (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
What led to the marriage of the main character's failure?
Because this book doesn't make much sense whether you read it or not, I do not suggest reading it.
This book's reading experience is generally subpar since the author's thoughts are conveyed more effectively through technique and genre than through a clear narrative.
It is appropriate for skimming, not for close reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in how to do it. It just points out the direction but does not give specific methods.
Furthermore, the book feels like a patchwork.
Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people.
I don't know if it is a story compiled for the sake of example, but it will be more convincing if some cases experienced by the author are given.
The terminology fluctuates between "customer" and "client".
The title is "customer", but in the text it becomes "client".
There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering in e-books.
Anyway, this book is a good introduction to the theory, but not very suitable for people already in sales work who are looking to improve their sales.
A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance
The book is shallow and can be said to be just an introductory course that can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to know more about it, you have to find it and dig it yourself.
Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the later subsidy wars between Alipay and WeChat to cultivate user habits. The current market share of third-party payments is probably much larger than what is mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring their mobile phones when they go out to eat, and because of the high bank turnover, merchants have abandoned UnionPay.
Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has many years of experience observing finance and is very familiar with the history of financial development both domestically and abroad, which is why he was able to write such accessible content.
It's easy to write high and mighty, but it's hard to write in a way that's easy to understand.
I admire you, and I want you to know it!
The primary factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough recognition and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
In fact, the majority of Chinese people are "I love you hard to express" people who will keep their feelings of adoration, thanks, and appreciation to themselves and refrain from expressing them out loud.
The author of this book explains the five languages of appreciation: physical touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, and desirable gifts.
I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to genuinely use these five languages to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer we are, the more we need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives will become better.
By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.
Due to reasons such as Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds, there are more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.
Once more, I'd want to thank the authors, translators, and editors for their labor of love!
Suspected shoddy goods, ask Amazon for strict scrutiny
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, no weight, not even as good as street stall products, no weight, no barcode, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose, which is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a return; It is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought a heart-to-heart, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, and added a few comparison photos to further verify the fakeness of the product. Clearer references to avoid financial loss and further unhappiness!
Once again, I hope that Amazon will be meticulous and strictly control the source of products.
The product is mediocre and does not meet expectations.
Benefits:
1. Big brands and cheap prices.
Advantage 2: Both the motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but there is a gap between the actual performance and my expectations.
Disadvantages:
There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, it is a handout, with no respect at all.
There is a strong unpleasant smell when charging, even if it's only for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong scent of burning plastic.
After a day of testing in the office, the whole room was filled with the smell of plastic.
Compared to the Philips product of the same price range that I used before, although this Panasonic product has an extra blade, the quality really lets consumers down.
Little Package
Upon receiving the package and seeing "e-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It was much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, probably a size M. The packaging didn't match the product description and images, probably a so-called new version.
The three stars are because I was sloppy and didn't read the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-size e-commerce version. What does it mean that your product is not the right version?
E-commerce routines are deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy when I have time.
That's it.
don't like the taste
The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste very much, and always says it's spicy. Maybe it's more appropriate to use another word to describe it. For the time being, this word is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Authentic product, well packaged.
The packaging is very complete, with an air bag added inside, not just a bare product as some online reviews mentioned.
The bottle's outer packaging also has a layer of plastic film as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be available again.
A terrible shopping experience
I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I still didn't receive it. Upon inquiry, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and they all said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the package was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. Anyway, it was quite frustrating.
Wrong photo
I thought I could receive a headset like Figure 1, but unexpectedly I received a headset like Figure 2. It's fine if the pictures are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the volume of the left and right earphones is different?
Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can pay attention to it. In addition, I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.
The operating system is mediocre.
After using it for a while, overall the display is okay, I don't feel much difference, it's just that this system is frustrating to look at. The boot time is noticeably slow, and it's impossible to set it up well. The included software doesn't even need to be mentioned, and the response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not on the same level.
I read the reviews saying that the design is very user-friendly. I haven't found anything user-friendly. The position of the remote control, the commonly used up, down, left, left, and right, return button design is really unflattering.
So, just treat it as a TV, and use it with additional things like a TV box.
The price cut is too substantial
The price drop is too drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!
I have accumulated many unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content for all of them.
If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points above.
For poorer products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when buying, and the merchant will improve the quality of the product accordingly.
Low price, good cable, no fever, that's enough!
It is such a cheap cable, but it should have reached the hdmi certification standard. Compared with the domestic Akihabara bullshit (the price is twice as expensive), the cable body is thick and soft, and the 7-meter transmission has no noise. Look for Baseus for the low price line in the future!
Things are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing the order, I realized I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The link to contact customer service on the website kept showing an error, so I couldn't get in touch.
When the goods arrived, the delivery person called me. I said I didn't want it and wanted to cancel the order but couldn't. The delivery person took it back and said he would sign for me first and let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once signed for. I had no choice but to call Amazon's customer service, and they said the same thing, that signed items cannot be returned.
I have bought items that cannot be returned according to policy from JD.com and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and the customer service always allowed me to return them. Even when the diapers from JD.com had a strong smell after opening, the customer service still allowed me to return them. But with Amazon, it's not possible.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with them?
They told me either I accept it myself, or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should I make him pay for something he didn't buy?
Okay, I accept it myself and will not want a refund, but I must give your service 1 point
Advise everyone not to waste money
In the first place, if you look at the packaging, you can see that it is good, but there is a box that is basically soft and soft, and the appearance is not visible, you have to feel it, eat it in your mouth completely without taste, you have no taste, you bite the pulp a circle is dark yellow or bad, it is good or bad, you can eat less than a third, you are advised not to buy it, it is not cheap, the quality is too bad!
I learned from my mistakes and will never buy fruit from an e-commerce company again!
Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which should have been caused by a strong impact. Looking at the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it's food packaging and it's too simple. Moreover, it's an international purchase, and I didn't see any obvious anti-counterfeit labels. Opening the bottle was very easy, and the key point is that a layer of honey directly came out from inside the cap. There was almost no stickiness when opened, is this how all foreign products are?
As someone born in China, I'm a bit confused.
It should be genuine, right?
Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive around the 20th, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe all of this is normal?
Improved pick-up service is required
I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a rest day. Both the website and WeChat did not indicate that appointments need to be made on working days, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.
Good shopping
Nice stuff!
I still believe in Amazon's self-operated products. Now it's very convenient to buy overseas, and the delivery time is only a few days longer than domestic ones. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance capabilities for overseas purchases to China are still very strong, which is faster than transshipment. Much faster, so many things are now purchased overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to go out and buy back than in China, and I hope to improve.
Garbage
Seeing such a package, I ask everyone: Don't you think it's garbage on the side of the road?
A plastic fragile package is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is such a package responsible?
I see this packaging as if it's for garbage. The product was purchased with extremely shoddy packaging, with no measures to prevent damage. It was simply wrapped in a plastic bag. Upon receipt, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were damaged.
If I just encountered one like this, I would accept it, but I bought several like this, contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I have a question, if I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards? And I have to send the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this making purchasing a product a hassle!
I kept asking the customer service who was responsible for this issue, but they didn't admit it was their fault, not even a word of responsibility. What kind of guarantee does such after-sales service provide? In one word: admit defeat! But I guess Amazon won't even give me the chance to publish this review, they'll just delete it!
Good quality, 5 stars, poor logistics
1. The quality is very good, it is a flash sale, the price is moderate, and it is worth the money.
2. Strong, sufficient materials, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.
3. The logistics is flawed. The order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon didn't mark the expected delivery date as February 7th, I might be very satisfied.
5. However, marking the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user feels very bad.
6. If you are not sure of making a promise, don't make a promise.
7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by merchants.
8. So, I gave a low score.
The gold thread will fade in color.
The effect is there, but whether it is felt is a matter of personal preference, or psychological effect.
One downside is the golden thread, which was originally designed for aesthetics, but in reality, this gold thread fades. If it is placed in the car and moved a few times, there will be some gold dust on the hands and in the car.
I wish the product could be enhanced.
This kind of square shape has no decorative effect, so don't put gold wires on it, it will be troublesome if it falls off and stains the car.
The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, and they are divided into two packages with different packaging.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but the two items were split into two packages, and the packaging was not the same. One was obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached and a layer of plastic sealed, and the outer packaging was also easy to unpack. The other one was like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions considered done, which felt a bit perfunctory.
The Yalan mattress is really nice
The 34CM mattress is unusually thick, you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, it is quite soft, the sleep is very comfortable, and I fell asleep quickly when lying on it.
Upon receiving the mattress, there were two stains due to rough handling during delivery. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and efficiently resolved the issue.
It's not a self-operated product; Amazon is shameless
The page clearly indicates that it is self-operated, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, the after-sales service is the responsibility of the supplier, and if there are any problems, you need to contact the supplier directly.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has already been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return or exchange goods, even if you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one will pay attention to you, you need to contact the supplier for returns yourself.
What the hell kind of self-operated merchandise is this?
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier," and claimed that it is self-operated. This is too shameless, blatantly faceless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!
A depressing experience
The filter cartridge I previously bought online from another store had a good filtering effect, and even after 28 days, there was no scale even if it was used for an extra day or two.
Since the quality of the items I've always bought from Amazon has been good, I thought I'd buy from here this time. This is my first time buying a filter cartridge on Amazon, and the experience is not very good. Not only did scale start to appear early, but there was also floating small black carbon powder in the filter cartridge all the way to the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. Very frustrating~
It's not as good as it looks.
Compared with the power strips I've used before, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the shopkeeper described. From the perspective of ease of use, whether each independent unit is powered lacks display.
While waiting for the right moment to assess the product's quality, the box is damaged.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner box seems to be new, but the instruction manual doesn't seem to be new. I just renovated in September and am stocking up, I hope it won't be broken by then. Amazon, please explain why several customers mentioned damaged packaging, yet you seem to be okay with it. Thank you!
Overall good, a little problem
This was my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several reviews, I felt that LAICA offered better value for money, so I chose this one. After receiving the product and installing the filter according to the instructions, I found it generally satisfactory. However, it seems that the unfiltered water might mix with the filtered water when pouring, as the seal on the raw water compartment doesn't seem very tight.
When you use it, you must wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
The image is incomplete.
The picture does not show the details of the side. The details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body. There is a big difference. This is one. This bead is made in Thailand, and there is no indication of the place of origin. This is the second. There is no indication of the texture. This is the third. When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. There was only a simple plastic bag here, and there was no product logo on the beads. How could I judge whether it was true or not.
It is important to be careful about what you buy, especially if it comes from Hong Kong.
Customer support on Amazon is atrocious
The order placed two days ago, received it today and found that it was reduced by 40 yuan, and it took a lot of time to find customer service, and the customer service said that there was no way to make up the difference, and it could be repurchased and returned.
This customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than some of the other deals.
Okay, for a beginner, it's worth purchasing
The quality is decent, not comparable to the best King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred. This is my first time playing King Kong, and it’s okay.
It's a good thing.
The product is really good, a gift for my girlfriend, but I had some unpleasant experience with the delivery at noon when I was not in Canada. The logistics company directly put it in the mail storage box and did not send me a verification message for pick-up, causing me to make two trips.
But the item is indeed good.
Worth purchasing
The little monkey is cute, and Amazon offers great discounts. The official website of Chow Sang Sang ships the goods directly. I placed the order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. It's really fast.
Postal couriers are also responsible.
Great!
A client's admission
Upon receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service told you not to worry, they would contact you in about 54 hours.
Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that a specialist will handle this issue and inform you of the result.
You will never take the initiative to contact this commissioner, you don’t know her job number, and there is no direct contact phone number, that is, you can’t contact her, only she can contact you.
Tragically, I waited for nearly three days, and the commissioner contacted me, and I left my cell phone for a while without receiving a call from the commissioner.
I waited for two hours for the commissioner to call, and during this time, I called Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to call me back.
Nearly three days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon's response will be to the defective coffee machine I received!
The products from Amazon US are fine, overseas shopping is a good method, but the service is far inferior compared to Amazon US.
For me, I can only continue to wait.
The bottom is not flat
Because the reviews were all very good, I had high expectations for this pot. I was very pleased when I received it because it was lightweight. However, I encountered a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and dips around the edges, causing all the oil to run to the sides. The large piece of fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, and I doubt I can cook normally with this design.
I don't know if I was unlucky and just happened to get a pan with an uneven bottom, but fortunately Amazon offers a one month return, so I decisively returned it.
I scrubbed the pot clean and returned it, having wasted half a day for nothing.
Good product design requires a matching manufacturing process to achieve
This is a product with a very simple design.
In the shape of a cube, the designer treated the top with a slightly curved surface.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
This is because there are two components at the top, the control panel at the front and the water box top at the back.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are not consistent, after piecing together there is a height difference of up to 2mm or so.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it arguably destroys the whole sense of design.
I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.
It appears that the product managers at Midea are still unable to produce goods of this caliber.
(Of course, I can't expect too much from the after-sales representative, but when I heard her say that not just the product I purchased has issues, but all individuals who use it do as well, I realized that you can't expect too much from Midea), The water pump stopped working on July 7, 2019, and there was little water output, following the second repair, which was made two weeks following the first, it broke once more.
It's a great deal after the discount, but Amazon's fake discounts are very disappointing.
I bought it one week after the baby was born, and it has excellent insulation.
Even if you are not concerned about getting burned, there is no sign of heat on the outside of the pot, which successfully keeps the heat from escaping.
After a night in an air-conditioned room, it can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said there was a big discount of 320 for the anniversary event, but later found out that everyone had 249, 289, 299, and instantly felt deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it's still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price, and it can be carried with the car when going out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
I've been watching it for a long time, saw the 6300 on sale on Amazon US, same price on Amazon China's overseas purchase, so I quickly placed an order.
I ordered on September 2nd, and the expected delivery was on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days in advance, which was fast!
The packaging is not big, it is Vitamix original packaging, and Amazon is not afraid of the crash floating in the sea!
Although the machine appears to be brand-new and has all the necessary components, the cup shakes so violently on the base that I am frightened it may fly out when the machine is switched on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and he described it as not as loose as mine.
The accompanying recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I can’t find a Chinese version on the Internet, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer, it is estimated that it can arrive in 3 days, and then I will toss it well!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
It's not a large size at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one has no umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is average. 3. It is clearly written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person. It is probably not enough for two people.
On the contrary, the one I bought from Amazon US before can be used by three people without any pressure.
I'm not feeling too good about this.
Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from getting scratched when laid flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth with the handle area protruding.. and so on, various dissatisfactions. Lastly, the zipper is a bit unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do indeed feel quite good.
It's okay.
Advantage: This backpack is quite delicate and appears to be durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot fit (it could be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the customer, and it cannot be described as service-oriented.
Overall it's okay, not sure if it's real leather.
Overall, it feels okay, I can't tell if it's real leather, so I can't make a blind judgement.
It can hold A4-sized documents, even those with a thickness of more than 80 pages, but it may not be able to hold a box-shaped object that is too thick and hard (not deformable).
The bag is very soft, and the interior compartments are quite user-friendly, which is pretty good.
It's just that there is a small sand eye at the bottom of the one I got. I don't know if it's my bad character or not?
I couldn't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning and exchanging the item, so I put up with it.
Overall, it's worth four stars.
ForRoyal is well-known worldwide for their camera straps and SLR straps
This strap is designed scientifically, it is practical to hang on both shoulders, and the front is fixed and protected by soft material, unlike other quick shooters that use screws to fix the bottom and damage the camera, and it is also convenient to take off the camera.
Terrible After-sales Service
I bought a piano a month and a half ago, it was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me the after-sales service number. Despite multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this!
I guess it would be even more troublesome to repair it in the future. For those who expect good after-sales service, you might as well take a detour, it's too much trouble!
There are minor flaws, but the tone is good.
The headstock is defective and missing a corner, it feels defective and there are no freebies, but it's good enough for the price and the instrument sounds good.
It's okay, the first one
Though the bass does not come through, other than that, it has been in use for a while, and the entirety is not poor.
The workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
When I first bought it, there was something wrong with it, all the lights were flashing and it couldn't be used.
I requested for an exchange, but even after the goods arrived in Shanghai three days ago, they still haven't been delivered.
Calls to the delivery service were not answered.
The courier service claimed to have only that one contact.
I can't find a place to complain on Amazon.
The delivery was delayed at my request, even though there was no request for it to be done - a text message confirming this appeared.
Then they mentioned some issue with the transit.
The poor shopping experience led to doubts about the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I don't think I'll get it today.
The label has poor adhesiveness and is not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and there is no film on the surface; moreover, the label's adhesiveness is very poor, it's completely unsuitable for cable labels, it falls off very easily. Friends who bought it for cable management need to be aware of this.
The pen is ok, but the package is too skimpy, just a cardboard box with no protection whatsoever, and the box that holds the pen is stuck on with a big piece of clear adhesive, and the adhesive is all over the box when you tear it off.
It cost $600 and was a disappointment.
However, the pen works just fine.
Hope to see more improvements on the packaging!
The quality is unquestionable, but in terms of writing, it's not as good as 925-25.
First, let's praise the daily express delivery, air freight, super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I've been using the 925-25, which is great. I just received the 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable and the style is very beautiful. The reason I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and the cap adjustment for the lead length is a bit shaky. Personal opinion: the 925-25 is more handy than the 85.
Therefore becoming a devoted fan of Amazon
I bought it at a super discounted price, but the child didn't like the reading pen.
It has been opened, and when I attempted to request a return, it was picked up at no cost to me.
That's awesome.
Returns are not encouraged, but this kind of service is unique in China.
I hope it will not be abused.
From now on, I will buy all my books here.
The headphones are off-key, and there's a murmur
This headset is really rubbish. I don't know if it's something wrong with my ears or if this headset really isn't as good as before.
I bought a blue one from a certain easy purchase two years ago, the sound quality was pretty good with no noise and decent bass. After using it for more than two years and it broke, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), as I feel it was quite good.
I saw a pretty good-looking purple one and bought it. But when I opened it today and listened to it, I realized something was wrong - one side was louder than the other.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effects of that song and didn't think much about it, but after listening for a long time, I realized that this problem is very serious, not only is the sound biased, the bass effect is not as good as my previous one, and there is some noise, is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not up to par?
Very poor evaluation, very disappointing.
Be sure to return tomorrow during the day.
PS The appearance is not bad.
This AV amplifier is complex to set up, roughly made, and generates a lot of heat.
The sound will take a while to comment!
Just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14th. The exterior workmanship is so poor.
1. The front panel and the knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input socket on the rear panel and the speaker output terminal are all bad. Just find a 1000-2000 CD power amplifier all-in-one machine, which is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and the side of my transformer is still dented. As a last resort, I opened the box and restored it with my hands. The top cover and front panel came loose.
4. The machine as a whole has a biased center of gravity toward the transformer end, which makes it difficult to move.
It has the impression of being a basic Sony device that was only produced in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony would be much better off outsourcing to China than to Malaysia.
5. The machine heats up a lot. The two channels used to watch the movie are 40-50℃ when you touch the top cover with your hands. I don't know if the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
The majority of power supplies used today are switching power supplies, and this ridiculously huge transformer weighs approximately 4KG.
Sony needs to utilize a fan that actively removes heat from the device while remaining silent, Only the sizable aluminum heat sink on the tube is visible after the package has been opened.

I haven't opened it.
The battery is working.
I want to see what's in it.
Later on, I thought, if I was disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of money; if I was satisfied after opening it, it would be difficult to put it back together, and I wouldn't be happy using it.
Well, let's just assume that Sony uses good battery cells.
As for the detailed explanation of electricity, it generally makes people feel uneasy.
I'm fine. I've worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I'm also half a battery engineer, so I can handle it.
Overjoyed.
I really had no idea before buying, but as soon as I opened it and saw the packaging, I felt reassured!
The headphone cable was incredibly flexible and of such high quality that when I finally touched it, I couldn't wait to connect it to my phone and launch QQ Music.
I was amazed that the sound quality was even surround 3D stereo.
I asked in a physical communication store, it's about 30 for a similar one, but definitely not the Pisen brand, it's a miscellaneous brand. Therefore, although this Pisen is 27, it's definitely worth having for its cost performance!
The Worst Online Shopping Experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but I still hadn't received the goods by October 12.
When I checked the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide a tracking number, so I couldn't find where the order was.
An email was sent to the seller asking if the courier number could be provided, and no reply was received after two days.
After a few minutes, the phone rang again, and I was told that I had lost a piece of the courier, so I could send it back again.
Despite my intense rage, I didn't say much to the seller and simply asked for them to deliver the computer over right away because I needed it so badly.
However, when I called the next day to ask if it had been shipped,
the seller said it hadn't and that it could only be shipped in the afternoon.
The seller told me it will be delivered after five or six in the afternoon when I called again in the afternoon, but when I called at seven in the evening, nobody picked up.
On the morning of the third day I called again and asked if the goods had been sent out.
Could you let me know the order number?
The vendor claimed he didn't ship it and advised me to get it from another store if I needed it right away, If I could wait, he said, I could send it in the afternoon.
No way, placing an order from another store takes a lot of time.
Just request rapid shipping from the seller.
On October 16th, finally, after numerous phone calls, I got the computer.
I don't know the computer's quality because I purchased it for someone else, but I will post remarks later.
I just bought it for half a year and haven't used it a few times, and now it has a bad contact. Can I have it repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I didn't use it much after buying it.
I've only used it a few times in my suitcase.
Recently, I found that it doesn't charge when connected to the power source. I need to manually adjust the connection between the charger and the wire a few times before it can charge.
I wonder if it's a problem with the interface, or if it's something that can be fixed now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!
Five stars for goods, one star for logistics, and an average of three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon would choose to ship with EMS, which is widely recognized in the industry as unreliable. After all, a computer is a valuable item!
The order said that the 20th was expected, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send it from Xiamen to Fuzhou!
On the morning of the 22nd, the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, and I was ready to happily receive the goods. However, in the evening, without receiving any calls or messages, I checked the logistics and found that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it!
I was shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I'm not sure what to do with my life.
Finally, I returned the machine to the collecting location.
The item is fortunately not lost, but specifically because the courier brother just switched the two tracking numbers.
I firmly advise Amazon not to employ EMS, I won't buy it again from Amazon if they start using EMS for rapid shipping in the future.
The goods are not bad
First of all, I found out that the price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which is disappointing. The product itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest you spend some money to add a solid state drive). Yesterday I took it to the after-sales service for a hardware check, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Win8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but it's a pity that there were no gifts.
(By the way, when buying keyboard film, definitely do not go to a Taobao store called E Cool Digital Center. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they do not accept returns or exchanges for faulty products. The owner also uses foul language. Just a special mention.)
The product is very good, but the platform bureaucracy remains.
Hard drives are of very good quality and cost effective, cheaper than those purchased in Hong Kong, and are highly recommended if they are not in a hurry and can tolerate logistics.
However, I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as when I swore never to use it a few years ago. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always that it will be delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!
The goods have been received for a few days, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about ten days!
Logistics is a headache.
It arrived in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the appliance packaging was also open, I don't even know if anything was switched.
FYI
I haven't used it yet, but I always trust Philips, so I'm hoping the battery life is longer than that of other brands.
I looked it up online, it might be a common problem with water ingress, and there's no warranty.
Depressed!
Now that it's wrapped in cling film and continues to be used, I wonder how long it can last?
Bought something that has been opened by others.
A machine with a price of more than 300 yuan and a tax of more than 100 yuan is indeed relatively high. I see that now there is more balance in the mind with a price of more than 600 yuan.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly let my husband try it before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, luckily there was no stubble inside the blade, otherwise how would I return it from so far away!
It is unknown whether it is easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term. As mentioned earlier, the things sent out when they are out of stock are really unreliable.
Above average in terms of experience.
It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.
I've been using it for half a year without any problems, brushing every day, and it needs to be charged about once a week.
On Amazon, brush head accessories are equally affordable.
The app is a bit difficult to use, apart from changing the colors and such, it seems that other compatibility issues are due to the overseas version?
I hope to learn Dafa.
Very cost-effective
It has been used 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2, It is incredibly simple to use and clean.
3. You can get a DIY haircut and save money.
In conclusion, this was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeits.
The last time I bought two packs, there were actually two different versions. Originally, the words on the lower left corner of the pack were green, but it turned out that one pack was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat got diarrhea after eating it.
I can't confirm whether the goods from Amazon are fake, or if they were switched by the staff during delivery.
I will buy it again, and if it is still fake, I will hold you accountable.
It's a horizontal bar!
The picture on Amazon shows a slash, but what they sent me is a horizontal bar, isn't this deceiving?
The effect is fine.
Cats love to eat, and that's the point.
And it is effective.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grind the instep.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but it's a pity that this model is too bad.
Addendum: Today I compared the insoles of the previous UN series shoes (the shoes were thrown away but the insoles were kept for use), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.
2. The instep of my instep is not too high, and the cruciate part is about 3 cm forward from the highest point of the instep.
3. Only one pair of the three pairs of Clarks I purchased abroad fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the Clarks from my favorites.
I'll try Rockport next, if it doesn't work, I'll have to go to the ECCO physical store.
The quality control is poor, substituting inferior for good.
First of all, what is worth affirming is that Prime is very effective in buying Ups overseas. The order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bigger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide, and 7.5W. The upper foot is a little loose, but I usually like to wear looser shoes, and a pair of insoles are just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. The rubber on one sole is damaged, and the other upper has various scratches and a needle eye. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced, which is obviously shoddy!
I sort of regret it!
I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a good deal for Asics. Of course, according to the reviews, there are even lower prices.
Now let’s talk about the shoes. Advantages: The shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well without being baggy.
The shoes are very attractive but the drawbacks are also obvious: I usually wear size 40, but this time I bought 40.5, and there is about a thumb's width of space at the front of the shoe. However, this does not affect anything.
The shoes are quite "narrow", even though there's space in the front, they feel tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable, as my feet feel very hot when wearing them now.
Putting pressure on the instep
First and foremost, the shoes' craftsmanship is excellent, and they are well worth the price.
My feet are quite standard, with running shoes at UK7.5, EU41.5, and leather shoes at UK6.5. I've bought several pairs from Amazon's Aibu, and they've always fit well. However, for this pair, I bought a size larger (UK7) based on the reviews. The shoes were noticeably too long because they were a size too big, but because the insoles were too thick, they still pressed hard on the top of my foot. Combined with the hardness of the walking shoes, they were very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly slender, it is not recommended.
You can change the insole if you have to buy it, but the original insole looks really high-end, so it's a shame not to use it.
A perfect shopping experience!
I am very satisfied and like it very much. There is no doubt that Amazon's overseas purchases are genuine. The quality is also very good, the quality is low, and the purchase is assured. The after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer service attitude is very kind and kind, the handling of problems is patient and efficient, and the worries are perfectly solved. The supporting express delivery to the door is very convenient and safe. The delivery master is very considerate of customers. He will remind them to pick up the goods from the express cabinet in time every time. Thank you Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family loves shopping overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely terrible!
I'm really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
I still want to voice my displeasure even if it's been a while.
I bought it in a spike in winter, less than 200, and it is useless to keep it at home for a few months.
When I was going to use it in the spring, I found that I couldn't connect to the bracelet. Both device manuals expressed their support for each other. Later, I found out that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because I still couldn't connect to other devices.
I called Amazon and requested them to put me in touch with the agency, who told me to pay for the shipping of the equipment to Shanghai for testing.
Almost half a month later, the items were returned exactly as they were sent, even the courier box was the one I used to send them!
There are no replies, receipts, or inspection reports!
Tell me at least whether it's nice or awful!
When I contacted to inquire, I was informed that sending it back in this manner indicates there is no issue with the apparatus, which is good.
The agency responded, "That's not their business," when I asked why I still can't connect.
I'm unfortunate because I'm too lazy to be hurled by you for 200 yuan stuff.
Seriously wrong.
It's very wrong.
Excellent material for the headband.
Much more superior than Nike.
Breathability is excellent as well.
Only the front cap.
Extremely fine.
Is it meant to be funny?!
It completely fails to block the sunlight.
It is not being returned because it makes a good headband.
Even if it doesn't block the sun, wear it upward.
Nevertheless, distinct from other headband designs.
For future use, keep it.
The products are of decent quality, Amazon doesn't uphold its end of the bargain, and the delivery person is excellent.
I want my package delivered on Saturday and Sunday!
Delivery on Saturday and Sunday is not permitted by Amazon's policies.
I had to drive 200 kilometers back from out of town to pick up the goods!
How am I supposed to love you again, Amazon?
The delivery man was very active and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
Commodities, just tried it, and it's not awful.
However, because I have never purchased identical things, I am unable to compare pricing!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is not bad, but the logistics is too slow. The previous shoes were all DHL. This time Apex is really... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low. I feel that the grade is higher than NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, they're all the same, so let's go for overseas online shopping.
Size: I am 176CM tall, 68KG, my shoulders are wide and I usually wear 180, I bought M, the hem is slightly long, the rest fits well. I see some recommend size S, is their figure so slender? Or do they prefer tight-fitting? I think hoodies should be a bit loose.
The perfect size
Bust 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before buying and was told that I should buy the xxl one, and then I read the reviews and decided to buy the L one. After receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right, and I was almost cheated.
The price of the Double Eleven is much higher than that of the Black Five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The most affordable product problem is troublesome!
"第 18 回日本サバイバルトレーニングステーション."
I purchased Z’s least expensive item, and the description stated that there were scratches, but when I received the item, I discovered that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The kid didn't want to return the item because he didn't believe it was a big deal, but when the kid's grandfather raced to several nearby hardware stores, he was unable to find such tiny accessories!
In the end, the grandfather glued them on!
It seems that I can't buy Z's affordable goods in the future!
Poor manufacturing quality for toys
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, it's very hard to screw in the bolts, which shows the poor processing quality. I don't know how long it can be played with. Since it's something promised to the child, I won't return it.
Is there a problem with just the one I got when other reviews claim that installation is not difficult?
Very general
Is it my bad luck?
The packaging is so old; the workmanship is very average; there is only one type of music and it's only 8 seconds long and then it repeats constantly; the action is just shaking its head and moving forward, with no variation.
It's not worth the price.
It's urgent, so I won't return it.
Although the toy is of good quality, I must criticize the packing
I received the express delivery yesterday. It was purchased from Amazon and marked as shipped by EMS, but in the end, it was delivered by Tmall's express delivery. How many detours did it take? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?
Speaking of the packaging, it was just wrapped in a few layers of cling film, without any bubble wrap inside. When I opened it, all the parts were just lying in the empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy is good and there were no broken parts. However, it's much smaller than I imagined. Since it's not battery-operated, it often derails when pushed by hand. I feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun
It's very fun, the components are highly precise, the craftsmanship is exquisite, and the quality is almost comparable to Lego. The price is very favorable during promotions.
The assembly process was quite fun, I did the assembly and my 5-year-old son played with it, it was great.
He played with amazement and laughter~ I will probably continue to buy this brand of toys in the future.
The device is new, and international shopping is good
I checked on Christmas, the one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the current delivery is a bit slower.
The equipment is still in fantastic shape and is very new.
Integrated Pikachu.
Then if you connect to the Poke Ball, you will get a Mew.
It is better than the PS4, and is more portable.
I have bought Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Producing poor quality goods, selling poor quality goods, resulting in poor service. I bought six watches to give to my children, one of which has an incomplete digital display, and the time on all six watches is inconsistent, varying by several hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watches were checked for the correct time when they were stored. They replied "yes". If so, why is there such a big difference in time? It's clear that the watches are not accurate, simply put, they are inferior products. It's not that I'm being harsh, but look, they are selling products with obvious quality issues (incomplete digital display), aren't these junk?
I contacted the seller, who gave a lot of reasons and complained that I shouldn't have bought their product in the first place. With such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In conclusion, I advise against buying from this seller, as the items purchased are just junk.
Shipping issues with Amazon
Upon receiving the shipment and inspecting it, I found:
1  The packaging is badly damaged
2. The watch manual has serious usage creases.
3. The watch doesn't work, the desk lamp can't be charged either, and the time can't be adjusted.
4, Contact Amazon customer support individually, and you can only mail to the United States at your own expense, with postage reimbursed later.
5. The reason for the 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
It can only be said to be passable.
The time is not very accurate, it is about one second faster every day, and it has been more than two minutes after only a few months of use.
I used to have a Citizen watch, and I feel it wouldn't be off by a few seconds even after one or two years.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is somewhat useless, basically not used, and occasionally it will accidentally enter the timer mode.
solar-powered sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging eliminates the need to replace batteries, it has world time, multiple alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror is easily scratched and dust can get in.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China is between 220-300, while overseas purchases can be obtained for just over 180 (delivery time is about a week).
Very pleased with the watch
It's definitely genuine, I've had it checked at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.
The watch keeps time very accurately, with errors well within the acceptable range. The packaging includes a jewelry appraisal certificate, and the 12 o'clock position on the dial is a real diamond. This is suitable for personal use and also makes a prestigious gift.
The Bentley watch is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience in history
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife dropped her phone, so on a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock but not sold directly by Amazon and there was no price increase (which made me secretly happy). However, because it was not sold directly by Amazon, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the latest expected delivery date would be September 27th.
My wife was extremely uncomfortable without a mobile phone. She woke me up at 6 o'clock the next morning to figure out a solution. Later, I checked on JD.com and saw that the 256G model was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to immediately order another one.
I planned to cancel the Amazon order as soon as I purchased the new one.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to receive the courier in the early morning. I called the customer service after 7 o'clock and asked to cancel the order. The customer service replied that it has been canceled, please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I waited patiently. At noon, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there and had not been shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order quickly, and the customer service replied that the operation was OK.
At 3:00 p.m., I checked the order on my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact the customer service again to make it clear that it was the third call. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to deliver the goods!
The customer service contacted the seller on my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would cancel the order after getting familiar with it.
However, I was told clearly that the seller already knew, so please rest assured that the goods will not be shipped.
When I looked at the order again on Monday, it showed that it had been delivered, and I was speechless.
I can only phone customer service since I can't get in touch with the merchant directly.
After that, I'm just at a loss for words, in essence, I say do this action, and customer service will continue to operate.
The order is getting ready to send it again and is currently still in the delivery refusal phase!
Wouldn't Amazon go out of their way to follow up?
It makes no difference if the seller's company has already collected the money and does not follow up.
To summarize, there will never again be prepayment for huge products, this is really too bothersome.
It looks wonderful
I fell in love with this camera a long time ago, but because of other reasons besides the price, I didn't buy it. This time, I bought it because it included free shipping and the price was okay.
After purchasing, everything else was fine except for the software connection, which just couldn't connect. My home uses a TP router, and after searching online, I found that many people have this problem. I spent over two hours adjusting various router settings, and finally managed to set it up using 360WIFI as a medium. During this time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions for this problem and directly told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
It is also noteworthy that I have seen comments on the Internet that the camera supports a minimum of 8G memory cards, and that smaller memory cards cannot be recognized, so I would like you to be aware of this.
It feels okay to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, and the machine has a certain degree of heat. If it is turned on all the time, it feels that this degree of heat is a bit unacceptable.
To summarize, this product still has numerous flaws, and I hope you would be cautious while purchasing it.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love in life. We were together for almost 3 years, and then she left me last year, up until now.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love in life. I don't know to what extent it's being used now, maybe it's been thrown away!
After nearly three years of dating, she left me last year, and every time I think of her, I feel so heartbroken that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, she left me with a lifetime of shadows and heartache, and I still haven't been able to move on.
When I bought this phone, I thought about the two feelings at the time, we could share weal and woe together, but now it's unbearable to look back. Perhaps life is like this, there are some people you don't want to meet in a lifetime, and some things you don't want to know in a lifetime, but what can you do?
Every time I see this Samsung phone, I am reminded of her and the pain that comes with it, filling my entire body. I've never allowed myself to use a phone that costs more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate. No matter how good you are to someone, when they change their heart one day, all the promises and vows will vanish into thin air.
The top national brands
Huawei is the best of national products.
Unlike the current corporate climate, which depends on promotion to grow popularity, low-key CEOs and businesses win clients through technology and quality!
It is impossible, and dare not, for a firm without strength to do so!
That is why I chose Huawei.
I've been using it for over half a year since I bought it, and it's been really good, very nice.
The reason why I didn’t give it a full score is because once when I used its offline navigation, there was a phenomenon of not positioning. I didn’t find out the reason in the end, and it was fine at other times.
Moreover, after you input the destination online, it automatically designs the route after searching. After leaving the wifi and setting off, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical. You don't need to use data, it directly communicates with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, which is very good!
Sony is great.
This low-end machine from Sony still has a great design, and it's cheap, with a big enough screen and first-class battery life, so it's perfect for the elderly.
While it's been a long time, the machine is still working perfectly well.
However, since my Z2 has been put away, this phone has also completed its mission.
