"When the charwoman arrived early in the morning – banging all the doors, as strong and hurried as she was, despite having been asked many times to avoid it, so that from the moment of her arrival no one in the whole apartment could get any more peaceful sleep –, at first she didn't find anything out of the ordinary during her usual brief visit to Gregor. She thought he was deliberately lying there so motionless, pretending to be offended; she credited him with all sorts of intelligence. Since she happened to be holding the long broom, she tried to tickle Gregor from the doorway with it. When this also showed no effect, she became annoyed and poked Gregor a little with it, and only when she had pushed him from his place without any resistance did she become attentive. When she soon realized the true situation, she widened her eyes, whistled to herself, but didn't linger for long, instead she yanked open the bedroom door and called loudly into the darkness: 'Just take a look, it's dead; there it lies, completely dead!'"
"When silence replaces sighing and lamentation, the two bodies lie stretched out in the dark next to each other. It will never be like today again, thinks Hans. This is how it will be forever now, thinks Katharina. Then sleep extinguishes all thoughts, and what has happened to them is inscribed onto their cerebral cortex as they lie quietly breathing beside each other."
"She also has a suitcase with letters, carbon copies of letters, and mementos, mostly flat items, as they are called in archival language. She has her diaries and calendars. The next day, she climbs the book ladder and retrieves the suitcase from the topmost shelf; it is dusty, both outside and inside. A long time ago, the papers from his boxes and those from her suitcase had a dialogue with each other. Now, they have a dialogue with time. In such a suitcase, in such a box, ending, beginning, and middle lie indifferently together in the dust of decades; what was written to deceive and what was thought to be true lie together, the unspoken and the recorded, all of it lies closely folded whether it wants to or not, the contradictory lies there, the silent anger as well as the silent love lie together in one envelope, in the same folder, forgotten things are just as yellowed and creased as what one still remembers, dimly or clearly. While her hands also become dusty from going through the old folders, Katharina must think of how her father always performed as a magician at her birthday parties. He had thrown a whole stack of playing cards into the air and then managed to pull out the one flying card that she or one of the other children had remembered beforehand."
"As they reached the Opera Café, the sky darkened. When they got to the Kronprinzenpalais, the storm broke, and a rain shower blew over the passengers as the bus stopped at Marx-Engels-Platz and opened its doors. Several people pushed their way in to seek shelter from the rain. And so she, who initially stood by the entrance, was pushed towards the middle.        Let me know if there's anything else you would like to add or adjust!"
"Of this dream, the afflicted one awoke unnerved, shattered, and powerless, succumbed to the demon. He no longer shunned the observing gazes of people; whether he exposed himself to their suspicion did not concern him. They too fled, departed; numerous beach huts stood empty, the occupancy of the dining room showed greater gaps, and in the town, one rarely saw a stranger anymore. The truth seemed to have leaked out, and the panic, despite the stubborn cohesion of interests, could no longer be held back. But the woman with the pearl jewelry stayed with her companions, whether because the rumors did not reach her or because she was too proud and fearless to yield to them: Tadzio stayed; and to the one enveloped by his feelings, it sometimes seemed as if flight and death could remove all the disturbing life around them, and he alone would remain with the beautiful one on this island,—yes, when in the mornings by the sea his gaze rested heavily, irresponsibly, unwaveringly on the desired one, when he at the end of the day followed him unworthily through streets where hidden death crept, the monstrous seemed promising, and the moral law obsolete."
"The sky was gray, the wind damp; harbor and islands had been left behind, and quickly all land vanished from the misty horizon. Flakes of coal dust, swollen with moisture, settled on the washed deck, which would not dry. After only an hour, a sailcloth roof was stretched out, as it had begun to rain."
"The sister hurried to the mother and held her forehead. The father seemed to have been brought to more definite thoughts by the sister's words, had sat up straight, played with his servant’s cap between the plates that still stood on the table from the roomers' evening meal, and occasionally looked over at the silent Gregor."
"The doors closed again, the bus started moving, she looked for a handrail.        And then she saw him.        And he saw her.        Outside, a real downpour was coming down, inside it was steaming from the damp clothes of those who had boarded.        Now the bus stopped at Alexanderplatz. However, the stop was under the S-Bahn bridge."
"This Hermine, whom I saw today for the second time, knew everything about me; it seemed impossible to ever have a secret from her. It may have been that she might not have completely understood my intellectual life; perhaps she could not follow me into my relationships with music, with Goethe, with Novalis or Baudelaire – but this, too, was very questionable; it was likely that even this would not trouble her. And even if it did – what was left of my 'intellectual life' anyway? Wasn't it all in shards and had lost its meaning? But my other, my most personal problems and concerns, she would understand them all, of that I had no doubt. Soon I would talk to her about the Steppenwolf, about the treatise, about everything and everything that had so far existed only for me, that I had never spoken a word about to another person. I couldn't resist starting right away."
"Once, it must have been about a month since Gregor's transformation, and by now it was no longer a special reason for his sister to be astonished at Gregor's appearance, she came in a little earlier than usual and found Gregor still there, motionless and in a rather frightening position, looking out the window. It would not have been unexpected for Gregor if she hadn't entered because his position prevented her from immediately opening the window, but she not only did not enter, she even drew back and closed the door; a stranger could have thought that Gregor had been lying in wait for her and wanted to bite her. Of course, Gregor immediately hid under the couch, but he had to wait until noon before the sister came back, and she seemed much more restless than usual. From this, he realized that his appearance was still unbearable to her and must continue to be unbearable for her, and that she probably had to force herself very hard not to run away at the mere sight of even the small part of his body that protruded from under the couch. To spare her even this sight, one day he carried the sheet on his back – it took him four hours to do this work – onto the couch and arranged it in such a way that he was now completely covered and that the sister could not see him even if she bent down. Had she thought this sheet unnecessary, she could have removed it, for it was clear enough that it could not have been Gregor's pleasure to lock himself up so completely, but she left the sheet as it was, and Gregor even thought he caught a grateful glance when he once cautiously lifted the sheet a little with his head to see how the sister took the new arrangement."
"He accommodates her with white wine to go with the trout, and notices in passing that she knows how to fillet a fish. She sees his glasses case lying on the table and the cigarette pack, brand Duett, and thinks that she never wants to sit at a table again where his glasses case, his cigarettes are not present."
"Exhausted, numb from the whirl of this strange morning, he settled down in an armchair by the open window after scattering the contents of his handbag around the room. The sea had taken on a pale green hue, the air seemed thinner and purer, the beach with its huts and boats more colorful, although the sky was still gray. Aschenbach looked out, his hands folded in his lap, content to be here again, shaking his head in dissatisfaction with his fickleness, his ignorance of his own desires. He sat like this for probably an hour, resting and dreamily lost in thought. Around noon, he saw Tadzio, who, dressed in a striped linen suit with a red tie, was returning from the sea, through the beach barrier and along the wooden walkways, back to the hotel. Aschenbach recognized him from his vantage point immediately before he had actually focused on him and wanted to think something like: ""Look, Tadzio, there you are again!"" But at the same moment, he felt how the casual greeting sank before the truth of his heart and fell silent,—felt the ardor of his blood, the joy, the pain in his soul and realized that it was because of Tadzio that saying goodbye had been so difficult for him."
"It is nice to walk beside him, she thinks.   It is nice to walk beside her, he thinks.        Twenty minutes of walking through the night. He knows the place well, has been there countless times, the waiter, as usual, gives him the table reserved for regular customers."""
"It was a song that the lonely one could not remember ever having heard; a bold hit in an incomprehensible dialect and equipped with a laughter chorus, into which the gang regularly erupted with full voice. Both the words and the accompaniment of the instruments ceased therewith, and nothing remained but a somehow rhythmically ordered but very naturally conducted laughter, which the soloist in particular knew how to render with great talent to the most deceptive liveliness. He had recovered all his insolence when the artistic distance between him and the distinguished audience was restored, and his artistic laughter, shamelessly sent up to the terrace, was mocking laughter. Already towards the end of the articulated part of the stanza, he seemed to struggle with an irresistible tickle. He sobbed, his voice wavered, he pressed his hand against his mouth, he shruged his shoulders, and at the given moment the unrestrained laughter burst forth from him, roaring and exploding with such truth that it became infectious and communicated itself to the listeners, causing an unfounded mirth, living only from itself, to spread among those on the terrace. But precisely this seemed to double the singer's exuberance. He bent his knees, slapped his thighs, held his sides, wanted to burst, no longer laughed but screamed; he pointed his finger upwards, as if there were nothing funnier than the laughing crowd up there, and finally, everyone in the garden and on the veranda laughed, down to the waiters, bellboys, and house servants in the doors."
"Early at five, ten o'clock Berlin local time, she stands up punctually for the start of the ceremony, places a candle on the hotel room's table, lights it, and plays music for him from the internet.   The second movement of Mozart's D minor Concerto.   The Aria of Bach's Goldberg Variations.   The Chopin Mazurka in A-flat.   Each of these pieces is interrupted by advertisements.   The new Hyundai. A bank offering home loans. A medication for colds.   When she returns to Berlin from Pittsburgh six weeks later, she sees the fresh mound of sand and the birch tree next to it. The roses she had a friend place on his grave are already cleared away. The friend tells her how the funeral was. Music was played.   What music?, she asks.   Mozart, Bach, and Chopin, says the friend.   She nods.   Half a year later, her husband is home when a woman delivers two large boxes.   She was crying, he says, I gave her a handkerchief.   The boxes remain in Katharina's office until autumn.       "
"At Ganymed on Schiffbauerdamm, his wife told him that she is pregnant. At Ganymed, he celebrated the first manuscript ready for print with his editor. Now he stands in front of the restaurant and waits for a nineteen-year-old girl.        The nineteen-year-old girl remembered his eyes, his nose, his shoulders all day yesterday and today at work. But how he looks as a whole, she might no longer know. Impatiently, she goes to meet her memory."
"Upon returning to the hotel, he went straight to the lobby's table with the newspapers and looked through the pages. He found nothing in the foreign-language ones. The local papers listed rumors, quoted fluctuating figures, reiterated official denials, and doubted their truthfulness. This explained the departure of the German and Austrian elements. The nationals of other countries evidently knew nothing, suspected nothing, and were not yet alarmed. ""One should keep silent!"" thought Aschenbach, agitated, as he threw the papers back onto the table. ""One should keep this a secret!"" But at the same time, his heart filled with satisfaction over the adventure into which the outside world seemed to be heading. For to passion, as to crime, the secure order and welfare of everyday life are not suited, and every loosening of the civic structure, every confusion and affliction of the world must be welcomed by it, as it can hope vaguely to find its advantage therein. Thus, Aschenbach felt a dark satisfaction over the officially concealed events in the filthy alleyways of Venice—this sinister secret of the city, which fused with his own deepest secret, a secret whose preservation was of the utmost importance to him as well. For the lover feared nothing more than that Tadzio might leave, and he recognized with horror that he would no longer know how to live if that should happen."
"Kairos, the god of the fortunate moment, is said to have a lock of hair on his forehead, and this is the only way one can grasp him. But once the god has slipped by on his winged feet, he presents the bald back of his head, which is smooth and impossible to hold with one's hands. Was the moment a fortunate one when she, as a nineteen-year-old girl, met Hans? On a day in early November, she sits down on the floor and begins to go through, leaf by leaf, folder by folder, the contents of the first, then the second box. Essentially, it is a field of rubble. The oldest records are from the year '86, the most recent from '92. She finds letters and carbon copies of letters, notes, shopping lists, yearly calendars, photos and negatives of photos, postcards, collages, here and there a newspaper article. A piece of sugar from Café Kranzler crumbles in her hands. Pressed leaves fall out from between pages, passport photos are clipped to pages with paper clips, a tuft of hair is stuck in a matchbox."
"Quietly flattering, he regretted the incident, called it extremely embarrassing for him and the institute, but wholeheartedly approved of Aschenbach's decision to wait for the piece of luggage here. Of course, his room was taken, but another, not worse, was immediately available. ""Pas de chance, monsieur,"" said the Swiss lift operator with a smile as they glided upwards. And so the fugitive was once more installed, in a room that almost perfectly resembled the previous one in terms of location and furnishings."
"With careful consideration, he chose a larger table, telling the waiter that there would be three of them. And now, as she is already in the know, they occasionally glance toward the door for the absent third person. For the appetizer, he explained to her, one absolutely must order the Bernese butter bouillon here, for it contains a quail egg. So they spoon their Bernese butter bouillon, each lifting the quail egg onto their spoon and marveling at the masterpiece. A quail egg, he says, emphasizing the last syllable and looking at her expectantly to see if she understands the joke. She returns the gaze. Thus, they have the first word in their shared vocabulary. And he has brought her a book of his own, so that she knows what he writes. His first gift to her. She should read the dedication later. Then once more they look toward the door and shake their heads – where could the unpunctual fellow be? They are in agreement with each other, they have their first secrets from the world; they know what only they will recall when they look at each other. Precisely for this reason, he must clarify the conditions before it’s too late."
"After several years of unrest and various trial residencies here and there, he eventually chose Munich as his permanent place of residence early on and lived there in a state of civic honor, such as is granted to the spirit in special individual cases. The marriage, which he had entered into at a youthful age with a girl from a scholarly family, was cut short by death after a brief period of happiness. A daughter, already a wife, remained to him. He had never had a son."
"Lately, he no longer contented himself with thanking the daily routine and fortune for the proximity and sight of the beautiful. He pursued it, he sought it out. On Sundays, for example, the Poles never appeared at the beach; he guessed that they attended mass at San Marco, so he hurried there, and entering from the brilliance of the square into the golden twilight of the sanctuary, he found the one he missed, bent over a prayer bench during the service. Then he stood at the back, on the rugged mosaic floor, amidst kneeling, murmuring, cross-signing people, and the dense splendor of the oriental temple weighed luxuriously on his senses. Up front, the heavily adorned priest wandered, handled, and sang, incense billowed up, veiling the feeble flames of the altar candles, and into the sweet, musty sacrificial fragrance seemed to blend softly another scent: the smell of the ailing city. But through mist and glimmer, Aschenbach saw how the beautiful one up front turned his head, sought him, and caught sight of him."
"He often lay there through the entire long nights, did not sleep a wink, and just scratched for hours on the leather. Or he did not shy away from the great effort of pushing a chair to the window, then climbing up the window sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning against the window—evidently only in some recollection of the liberation which had once lain in just looking out of the window. For indeed, he saw even moderately distant things more and more indistinctly each day; the hospital opposite, whose all too frequent sight he had once cursed, he could not see at all anymore, and if he had not known exactly that he lived on the quiet but thoroughly urban Charlottenstraße, he might have thought that he was looking out into a wasteland from his window, where the gray sky and the gray earth merged indistinguishably. Only twice did the attentive sister need to see the chair by the window before, after tidying up the room each time, she pushed it back to the window precisely and, in fact, from then on, even left the inner window wing open."
"He had already reached the point where he could barely keep his balance when the rocking became stronger, and very soon he had to make a final decision, for it was a quarter to eight in five minutes, when the doorbell rang. ""That's someone from the office,"" he told himself and almost froze, while his little legs only danced all the more quickly. For a moment everything remained quiet. ""They don't open,"" Gregor said to himself, caught in some absurd hope. But then, of course, as always, the maid walked to the door with a firm step and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear the first word of greeting from the visitor to know who it was - the chief clerk himself. Why was Gregor condemned to serve in a company where the slightest omission immediately aroused the greatest suspicion? Were all the employees every single one of them scoundrels? Was there no one amongst them who was faithful and devoted, who, even if they had only missed a few morning hours for work, became so plagued by guilt that they were practically unable to get out of bed? Was it truly not enough to send an apprentice to inquire - assuming any inquiry was necessary at all - did the chief clerk himself need to come, thereby showing the whole innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious matter could only be trusted to the mind of the chief clerk? And more due to the agitation into which these reflections had thrown Gregor rather than a proper decision, he heaved himself out of bed with all his might. There was a loud thud, but it wasn't a proper crash. The fall was somewhat softened by the carpet, and Gregor's back was more elastic than he had thought, hence the rather dull and not very noticeable sound. He had not held his head carefully enough and had hit it; he turned it and rubbed it on the carpet in irritation and pain."
"She knows that you lay the napkin on your lap before you begin to eat, she knows that you dab your mouth before you drink, she knows that you tip the soup plate away from you and not towards you, that you don’t prop your elbows on the table and don’t cut potatoes with a knife. Against all fear, all hope, everything that one cannot foresee and does not want to foresee, it helps to know that knife and fork should be placed side by side when you have finished eating, with the handles on the right side of the plate. In the face of this man, who sits across from her at this dinner as immense luck, as misfortune, and as a question, she understands: Now the life has begun, for which everything else was just preparation.        He thinks, she still looks beautiful even while chewing."
"Such completely useless thoughts in his current condition went through his mind while he stood upright at the door, listening. Sometimes he was so tired that he couldn't listen anymore and let his head rest lazily against the door, but he would immediately hold it up again, for even the small noise he caused had been heard next door and had made everyone fall silent. 'What is he up to again,' said his father after a while, apparently turned towards the door, and only then did the interrupted conversation gradually resume."
"Tadzio, along with three or four playmates who had remained with him, moved to the right in front of his family's hut, and, with a blanket over his knees, resting in his deck chair approximately halfway between the sea and the row of beach huts, Aschenbach watched him one more time. The game, which was unsupervised, since the women were likely busy with travel preparations, seemed chaotic and got out of hand. That sturdy boy, dressed in a belt suit and with black, pomaded hair, called ""Jaschu,"" provoked and blinded by a handful of sand thrown in his face, forced Tadzio into a wrestling match, which quickly ended with the fall of the weaker, more beautiful boy. But as if in the parting hour the servile feeling of the lesser one had turned into cruel brutality, seeking revenge for long servitude, the victor did not release the defeated even then, instead kneeling on his back and pressing his face so persistently into the sand that Tadzio, already out of breath from the struggle, threatened to suffocate. His attempts to shake off the oppressor were convulsive, ceased entirely for moments, and then repeated only as a twitch. Horrified, Aschenbach wanted to leap up to his rescue when the aggressor finally released his victim. Tadzio, very pale, half lifted himself and sat, supported by one arm, for several minutes immobile, with disheveled hair and darkening eyes. Then he stood up fully and walked away slowly. They called to him, initially cheerfully, then anxiously and pleadingly; he did not listen. The dark-haired boy, who must have been immediately gripped by remorse over his excess, caught up with him and tried to reconcile. A shoulder movement dismissed him. Tadzio walked diagonally down to the water. He was barefoot and wore his striped linen suit with a red bow."
"And now he plays for her the Impromptu in A-flat major by Franz Schubert, and from Bach, the Chromatic Fantasy, the Partita in E minor, and the third movement of Mozart's B-flat major piano concerto. Sometimes he nods his head in rhythm, sometimes he says: Isn't this something? Sometimes she says: This is beautiful. Sometimes she asks: Who's playing? Then he says: Arthur Rubinstein, Glenn Gould, Clara Haskil. Between Bach and Mozart, she went to the bathroom and saw their son's corduroy pants hanging on the line. And on the bathroom counter stood the bottle of the perfume that makes the apartment smell so nice, Chanel No. 5. And three toothbrushes in a cup. And a nightgown thrown carelessly on a stool, in the midst of everyday life. Come, dear May, and make the trees green again, the piano wishes at the very end, but it is already July, and outside the summer evening has turned into a summer night, the bottle of red wine is empty. Are you hungry? Yes. Then let's go get something to eat. Yes."
"And now?        Without either of them having to say a word about it, they steer their steps homeward again. Homeward now means, for them too: back to his house.        From below, they look up at the still brightly lit windows.  "
"And so she was not dissuaded from her resolve by her mother, who also seemed uneasy in this room, soon falling silent and helping her sister with all her strength to move the chest out. Well, Gregor could do without the chest in an emergency, but the desk had to stay. Hardly had the women, pressing against the chest with groans, left the room, when Gregor poked his head out from under the sofa to see how he could intervene cautiously and as considerately as possible. But unfortunately, it was the mother who first returned while Greta, in the next room, held the chest and swung it back and forth alone, of course, without being able to move it from its place. The mother, however, was not used to the sight of Gregor; it could have made her ill, so Gregor hurried in reverse to the other end of the sofa, but could not prevent the sheet at the front from moving slightly. That was enough to catch the mother's attention. She stopped, stood still for a moment, and then went back to Greta."
"And now, even though Gregor had likely lost his mobility forever due to his injury and, for the time being, it took him long, long minutes like an old invalid to cross his room – the thought of crawling up high was out of the question – he received, in his opinion, a completely sufficient compensation for this worsening of his condition in the fact that the living room door, which he had been keenly observing for one to two hours beforehand, was always opened in the evening. Thus, lying in the darkness of his room and invisible from the living room, he could see the entire family at the lit table and listen to their conversations, in a way with general permission, completely different from before."
"Our star, he says, must not enter the Earth's atmosphere, or it will immediately burn up. So, the star is still in the sky, pinned to the firmament with a thumbtack, like the photos on his bookshelf, she thinks with relief. She nods. She says Yes. He knows, he makes it difficult for her so that she has to say Yes. Immortal Sacrifices, that's the name of the song that comes to his mind. Whoever is allowed to make the sacrifice is chosen."
"Maybe he only went out with her to be able to come back again. To have the illusion that what is so familiar to him is also everyday life for her.        She goes ahead into the living room quite naturally, while he fetches a second bottle of wine from the kitchen.        When he comes into the room, she is standing by the window. The windowsill is so low that it wouldn't be difficult to tip out, she thinks. Over there, she says, someone else is still awake. That's a good friend of ours, he says, he paints. She surely hears that he said 'of ours'.        He thinks, she should know where she stands. She turns to face him. He holds a record in his hand, the cigarette hanging crookedly between his lips.        Take the pipe out of your mouth, you dog. Here is the Requiem. That probably doesn't fit now, she says.        Now, she said. The dead who lie in the earth do not sleep, but wait. Good music always fits, he says and puts the cigarette down.        Then let's, she says. He draws the record out of its sleeve and gently brushes over the grooves before he plays it.     "
"When the cleaning lady comes, Katharina moves them onto the couch, and when the room is clean, she moves them back onto the floor. When she has to set up the book ladder, she pushes them aside. There is no space in her shelf for two large boxes. The basement was recently flooded. Should she just take them to the trash as they are? She opens the top box and looks inside. Then she closes it again."
"How beautiful even the bones of such a fish are,"" he says, looking at the plate of bones, which resembles an ossuary, but also the great hall in the natural history museum where the huge dinosaur skeleton is displayed.        ""As a child, I learned to fish from my grandfather,"" she says.        For a moment, he sees her sitting with dangling legs on a dock, holding a fishing rod in the water. What power such a sentence has, he thinks. Sends a picture into one's head, whether one wants it or not."
"We will see each other, he says, only from time to time, but each time it should be like the first time – a celebration. She listens attentively and nods. That can only be your luxury, he says, because I am a married man. I know, she says. It might be that this will not be enough for you, he says, and that is your right. She looks him straight in the face; around her pupils, there is a yellow ring, he notices now. I not only have a marriage but also an affair with a woman at the radio station. And if you had a thousand women, she says, what matters is the time we have together. How could he ever refuse her anything when she asks for nothing? The black velvet ribbon, which makes her look like a boarding school girl, moves him immensely. If he doesn't quickly say what he has to say, it will be too late. And we must not reveal ourselves publicly together – I know and you know, that must be enough for us. That's okay, she says and smiles. Where conditions are negotiated, it is about something that remains. She was afraid yesterday and all day today that he would push her out of his life again."
"Will you come to my funeral?   She looks down at the coffee cup in front of her and says nothing.   Will you come to my funeral, he asks again.   She says, but you’re still very much alive.   But he asks a third time: Will you come to my funeral?   Yes, she says, of course I will come to your funeral.   A birch tree stands next to the spot I have chosen.   Beautiful, she says.   Four months later, she is in Pittsburgh when she receives the news that he has died.   It is her birthday, but even before the first congratulations from Europe, Ludwig, his son, calls her and says: Father died today.   On her birthday.   When his funeral takes place, she is still in Pittsburgh."
"While he is fetching the wine from the kitchen, she takes a few steps into the room and looks around. In front of the books stand small figures and tin toys, postcards are leaned against the spines of the books, photos are pinned to the shelves: A small child, apparently the son, sitting on a pony, an empty landscape with clouds, a beautiful woman on a Hollywood swing, probably his wife, she is laughing at the photographer, who might be him, Hans, her husband, but through the eternity of the picture, she now laughs at everyone who sees the photo, including her, the visitor of her husband. Behind her, he is now clinking with the glasses, he holds both in one hand, in the other, he has the bottle, shall we listen to some music?, he asks and goes over to the living room. Yes, she says and follows."
"For the second time, and now definitively, it was proven that this city, in this weather, was extremely harmful to him. Stubborn persistence appeared irrational, the prospect of a change in the wind entirely uncertain. A swift decision was necessary. Returning home already was out of the question. Neither his summer nor his winter quarters were prepared to receive him. But there was not only sea and shore here; they could also be found elsewhere without the harmful addition of the lagoon and its feverish miasma. He recalled a small seaside resort not far from Trieste, which had been favorably mentioned to him. Why not go there? And without delay, so that the change of stay would still be worthwhile. He declared himself resolved and stood up. At the next gondola stop, he took a vessel and had himself directed through the murky labyrinth of canals, beneath delicate marble balconies flanked by lion statues, around slippery corners of walls, past mournful palace facades reflecting large commercial signs swinging in the refuse of the water, to San Marco. He had difficulty getting there because the gondolier, in league with lace factories and glassworks, tried everywhere to drop him off for sightseeing and shopping, and when the bizarre ride through Venice began to exert its charm, the extortionist commercial spirit of the sunken queen did its part to sober him up in a displeased mood."
"There is no way back at all, neither to the wolf nor to the child. At the beginning of things there is no innocence and simplicity; everything created, even the seemingly simplest, is already guilty, already ambivalent, thrown into the dirty stream of becoming and can never, never swim upstream again. The path to innocence, to the uncreated, to God leads not backward, but forward, not to the wolf or the child, but ever further into guilt, ever deeper into becoming human. Even with suicide, poor Steppenwolf, you will not be seriously served, you will already go the longer, more arduous and difficult path of becoming human, you will have to multiply your duality many times over, complicate your complexity much further. Instead of narrowing your world, simplifying your soul, you will have to take in more and more world, eventually embracing the whole world into your painfully expanded soul, perhaps finally finding an end, finding peace. This is the path Buddha, and every great man, has taken, some knowingly, some unconsciously, as far as their daring succeeded. Every birth means separation from the All, means delimitation, isolation from God, painful re-becoming. Return to the All, annulment of the painful individuation, becoming God means: having expanded one’s soul so far that it is capable of encompassing the All once again.       "
"The figures into which you have seen your so-called personality fall apart. I can't play without figures."" He held a mirror up to me, and again I saw the unity of my person splinter into many ‘Is,’ their number seemingly increased. However, the figures were now very small, about the size of convenient chess pieces, and the player took several dozen of them with quiet, assured finger movements and placed them on the ground beside the chessboard. Monotonously, he spoke as a man repeating a lecture or speech he had often given:"
"You're a little boy. And just as you were too lazy to learn to dance until it was almost too late, so were you too lazy to learn to love. Ideal and tragic love, oh friend, that you can surely do excellently, I have no doubt about that, all respect for it! You will now learn to love a little more ordinarily and humanly. The beginning has been made, you could soon be allowed to go to a ball. Well, you still have to learn the Boston, we will start with that tomorrow. I will come at three o'clock. By the way, how did you like the music here?"
"It is a pleasure for me, dear Harry, to be able to entertain you a little today. You have often been very weary of life, striving to get away from here, haven't you? You long to leave this time, this world, this reality, and enter another, more suitable reality for you, a world without time. Do that, dear friend, I invite you to it. You know where that other world lies hidden; it is the world of your own soul that you seek. Only within yourself does that other reality live, the one you long for. I can give you nothing that does not already exist within you, I can open no other gallery for you than that of your soul. I can give you nothing, only the opportunity, the impetus, the key. I help you make your own world visible, that is all."
"""Did you understand even a single word?"" the Chief Clerk asked the parents, ""surely he isn't making a fool of us?""   ""For God's sake,"" cried the mother already in tears, ""he might be seriously ill, and we're tormenting him. Grete! Grete!"" she then screamed.   ""Mother?"" called the sister from the other side. They communicated through Gregor's room.   ""You must go to the doctor immediately. Gregor is ill. Quickly, fetch the doctor. Did you hear Gregor speak just now?""   ""That was the voice of an animal,"" said the Chief Clerk, noticeably quieter compared to the mother's screaming.   ""Anna! Anna!"" the father called through the anteroom into the kitchen, clapping his hands, ""fetch a locksmith immediately!""   And already the two girls ran through the anteroom with rustling skirts—how had the sister dressed so quickly?—and tore open the apartment door. One didn't even hear the door slam shut; they must have left it open, as often happens in homes where a great misfortune has occurred."
"»Dear parents,« said the sister and, by way of introduction, struck the table with her hand, »this cannot go on. If you perhaps do not realize it, I certainly do. I do not want to utter the name of my brother in front of that monster and will therefore simply say: we have to try to get rid of it. We have done everything humanly possible to care for and tolerate it, I believe no one can make the slightest reproach against us.«\"
"»What has happened to me?« he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular, although somewhat too small human room, lay quietly between the four familiar walls. Above the table, on which an array of textile samples was spread out – Samsa was a traveling salesman – hung the picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and placed in a nice, gilded frame. It depicted a lady, outfitted with a fur hat and a fur stole, sitting upright and raising a heavy fur muff, into which her entire forearm had vanished, toward the viewer."
