"When the maid arrived in the early morning – in a frenzy of strength and haste, she slammed every door, knowing from countless previous requests that such behaviour would make it impossible for anyone to sleep peacefully in the entire apartment – she found nothing out of the ordinary during her usual short visit to Gregor. She thought he was deliberately immobile and playing the fool; she gave him all the benefit of the doubt. As she happened to be holding the long brush in her hand, she tried to shake him off the door. When that also failed, she grew angry and shoved him aside, and only when she had forced him from his place did she notice. When she soon realized the true situation, she gasped in horror, sighed heavily, held her breath, but did not linger long, but burst through the bedroom door and shouted with a loud voice into the darkness: ""Just look, it's petrified; there it is, completely petrified!"""
"When silence takes the place of sighs and sobs, the two bodies lie stretched out in the dark side by side. Never again will it be like today, Hans thinks. So it will be from now on, Katharina thinks. Then sleep erases all thoughts, and what has happened to them is written on the surface of their brains as they peacefully lie beside each other."
"She too has a trunk with letters, crossed out letters and reminders, mostly mundane things, as archivists call them. She has her notebooks and calendars. The next day she climbs onto the bookshelf and retrieves the dusty trunk from the top drawer. The papers from her boxes and from the trunk have long since held a dialogue with each other. Now they are holding a dialogue with time. In such a trunk, in such a box, the end, the beginning and the middle are all equally valid within the dust of the years, the written lies alongside the unsaid and the described, the forgotten alongside the cherished, the contradictory, the silent anger and the silent love lie in the same package, in one and the same folder. The forgotten is just as faded and brittle as that which one still remembers, dimly or brightly. Katharina must, while her hands sift through the old folders, remember how her father used to appear as a magician at her birthday parties. He would throw a whole pack of playing cards into the air and then pluck out the one that she or one of the others had noticed beforehand."
"At the height of the opera cafe, the sky grew dark, and a thunderstorm broke out at the Kronprinzen palace. A drizzle of rain swept the passengers, as the bus pulled up at Marx-Engels-Platz and its doors opened. A few people rushed in to seek shelter. And so, those who had initially stood by the entrance were pushed to the middle."
"The troubled awakened from his dream, unnerved, discomposed and adrift before the demon. He no longer feared the watchful eyes of the people; whether he should evade their suspicions mattered not. They were fleeing too, traveling away; many beach shacks stood empty, the dining hall was sparsely populated, and the city held scarcely a stranger. Truth seemed to have drained away, panic struggling to contain itself despite the desperate clinging of the interested parties. But the woman in the pearl jewelry stayed with him, whether the rumors had not reached her, or because she was too proud and fearless to yield to them: Tadzio remained; and in his isolation, it sometimes seemed that flight and death could erase all that was disturbing in life’s round and leave him alone with the beautiful on this island—yes, even if this morning, at the sea’s edge, his gaze hung heavily, irresponsible and untethered, on the beloved one, while behind him, in the whispering gutters, death lingered in silent mockery, making him unworthy of its pursuit."
"The sky was gray, the wind dampish; harbor and islands had receded, and land vanished from the hazy circle of faces. Flakes of coal dust, tinged with moisture, settled on the dampened deck, which wouldn't dry. Already after an hour, a sail was furled out as rain began to fall."
"The sister hurried to the mother and placed her palm on her forehead. The father appeared to be stirred by the sister's words, straightened up, played with his servant's hat between the plates that were still on the table from the night's dinner, and sometimes cast a glance at the silent Gregor."
"The doors closed once more, and the bus moved on, searching for a platform.        And there she saw him.        And he saw her.        A real flood of people went outside, dampening the wet clothing of the commuters.        Now the bus stopped at Alex. The platform, however, was under the subway bridge."
"This hermine, whom I saw for the second time today, knew everything about me. It seemed impossible for her to have any secrets from me. It might be that she did not completely understand my intellectual life – perhaps she could not follow my relationships to music, Goethe, Novalis or Baudelaire – but this was also questionable. Perhaps she wouldn't have any trouble with that. And if so – what was left of my ""intellectual life""? Didn't that lie in ruins and had lost its meaning? But my other, my most personal problems and concerns, she would understand them all, I had no doubt about that. Soon I would talk to her about the Steppe Wolf, about the tractate, about everything that had existed only for me until now, about which I had never spoken a word to anyone. I could not resist starting."
"One month had passed since Gregor’s transformation, and there was no particular reason for his sister to marvel at his appearance any longer. She arrived a little earlier than usual and found Gregor stiff and rigid, his eyes fixed outside the window. It wouldn't have been surprising if she hadn't entered, given his position, which hindered him from immediately opening the window. Yet, she not only did not enter, but retreated and slammed the door. An outsider might have thought Gregor had tried to bite her. Gregor, of course, immediately hid under the blanket, but he had to wait until midday before she came back. She seemed far more restless than usual. He realized from this that she still could not bear his appearance and that she must have immense difficulty restraining herself even from the small part of his body which protruded from under the blanket. To spare her this sight, he one day put on his back – an effort that took him four hours – a layer of lint and arranged it in such a way that it largely obscured him. Even when she bent over, she could not see him. If it had been up to her, she could have removed the lint, for it was clear that it did not bring Gregor any joy to hide himself completely. But she left it as it was, and Gregor even thought he saw a grateful glance from her when, cautiously moving his head, he gave the lint a little sniff to see how she would react to the new arrangement."
"He gives her after, white wine with trout, and sees beside her that she knows how to gut a fish. He sees his glasses case on the table and the cigarette packet, brand Duett, and thinks that he'll never sit at a table again where his glasses case and cigarettes aren't."
"Exhausted and dazed by the commotion of this strange morning, he slumped in an armchair by the open window after distributing the contents of his handbag in the room. The sea had adopted a pale-green tinge, the air seemed thinner and cleaner, the beach with its huts and boats more colorful, even though the sky was still gray. Aschenbach gazed outwards, hands clasped in his lap, content to be back here but simultaneously dissatisfied with his fickle nature, his ignorance of his own desires. He probably sat thus for an hour, calm and dreamily speculative. Around midday, he saw Tadzio returning along the beach fence and wooden walkways from the sea, dressed in a stripped linen suit with red dye, a strange sight. Aschenbach recognized him immediately, before he actually saw him, and wanted to think: ""There you are again, Tadzio!"" But at the same moment, he felt the hesitant greeting vanish before the truth of his heart and felt the exaltation of his blood, the joy, the pain of his soul, and realized how difficult it had become for him to let Tadzio go."
"**First Text:**        It's nice to walk beside him, she thinks.        **Second Text:**        It's nice to walk beside her, he thinks.        **Third Text:**        Twenty-minute walk through the night. He knows the place well, has been there countless times. The waiter gives him the table that is reserved for regulars."
"It was a song that never belonged in the solitude's memory; a dreary ballad in an incomprehensible dialect, equipped with a laugh chorus in which the band regularly erupted full-bellied. The words and instrumental accompaniment were both audible, leaving only a rhythmic, somehow arranged, but naturally treated, laughter remaining. He had regained his whole audacity in the artistic distance he established from the lords, and his artless laughter, shamelessly dispatched to the terrace, was a joyful peal. Already towards the end of the articulated part of the stanza, he seemed to fight an irresistible tickles. He choked, his voice wavered, he pressed his hand against his mouth, shrugged his shoulders, and in that moment, he let out a howl and burst into laughter, with such authenticity that it infected the listeners and conveyed that there was unopposed, self-absorbed joy around him. This, however, seemed to contradict the singer's lack of self-control. He bowed his knees, struck his shins, clasped his sides, wanting to break away, he stopped laughing, he shouted; he pointed upwards with his finger as if there were nothing more comical than the laughing company up there, and finally everything in the garden and on the balcony, including the waiters, liftboys and household staff, erupted in laughter."
"Around five-ish, ten o'clock Berlin time, she punctually stands at the start of the ceremony, places a candle on the hotel room table, lights it, and plays music from the internet.        The second movement of Mozart's D Major Concerto.   The Aria of Bach's Goldberg Variations.   Chopin's Mazurka in A.        Each of these musical pieces is interrupted by commercials.        The new Hyundai. A bank that issues home loans. A medication for a cold.        When she returns to Berlin six weeks later, she sees the fresh sandhill and beside it the birch tree. The roses she had placed on his grave have been removed. Her friend tells her how the funeral went. Music was played.        What was that? she asks.        Mozart, Bach and Chopin, her friend says.        She nods.        Half a year later, her husband is home when a woman drops off two large boxes.        She has cried, he says, I gave her a tissue.        The boxes remain in Katharina's working room until autumn."
"In Ganymed on Schiffbauerdamm, his wife had told him that she was pregnant. In Ganymed, he celebrated the completion of his first draft manuscript with his lecturer. Now he stands before the local and awaits a nineteen-year-old girl.        The nineteen-year-old girl had known his eyes, nose, and shoulders yesterday and today for the whole workday. But how he looks as a whole, she doesn't know anymore. Impatient, she defies her memory."
"In the hotel, he returned at once to the hall near the newspaper stand and glanced through the pages. He found nothing familiar in the foreign languages. The local news carried rumors, tossed about figures, gave official denials and cast doubt on their veracity. Thus the withdrawal of the German and Austrian element was explained. The members of the other nations seemed oblivious, uninformed, unalarmed. ""One must keep silent!"" Aschenbach exclaimed, throwing the journals back on the table. ""But at the same time, his heart filled with satisfaction over the adventure the outside world wanted to create. For passion, like a crime, is not in accordance with the secure order and well-being of everyday life, and every loosening of bourgeois morals, every confusion and yearning for the world must be welcome, because it can find its advantage in it."" Aschenbach felt a dark satisfaction about the necessarily pompous procedures in the muddy streets of Venice—this sinister secret of the city that dissolved with his own secret, and in whose preservation he had a great interest. For the beloved one cared nothing that Tadzio could leave and did not realize without relief that he would no longer be able to live when it happened."
"Kairos, the god of the happy moment, it is said, hovers above the brow, and there one can hold him. But once he has once flown past on his feathered feet, he presents one with the bald skull, blank and unapproachable. Was was a happy moment when they met at nineteen? On a day in early November, she sat on the floor and began to go through the contents of the first, then the second carton. In essence, it is a field of debris. The oldest records date back to 86, the youngest to 92. She finds letters and cuttings of letters, notes, shopping lists, calendars, photos and negatives of photos, postcards, collages, here and there an article from a newspaper. A piece of sugar crumbled in her hands from the Kranzler Cafe. Printed leaves fall out between pages, ID photos are stapled to pages, a bundle of hair is stuck in a cardboard box."
"Quietly stroking his cheek, he lamented the incident, calling it highly embarrassing for him and the institute, but readily accepted Aschenbach’s decision to expect the luggage. Certainly, his room was assigned, another, not worse, immediately available. “Step right up, sir,” grinned the Swiss lift attendant as they entered. And so the refugee was accommodated once more, in a room that was almost identical in location and furnishings to the previous one."
"He had carefully chosen a larger table. We're three now, he told the host. And now, she has been inducted, hold her and keep looking out for the third who's left. For an appetizer, he explained, one absolutely has to have goose butter broth here, because there's a quail egg in it. So they scoop up their goose butter broth, lift each quail egg onto their spoons, and marvel at the wonder. A quail egg, he says, with an emphasis on the last syllable, and he watches her expectantly, wondering if she understands the joke. She returns his gaze. And so, their first word in their shared vocabulary is spoken. He also brought her a book so that she knows what he writes. His first gift for her. The dedication she is to read later. Then look back towards the door and shake their heads – where is the unpunctual fellow? They are in agreement with each other, they share their first secrets with the world, they know what they can remember only when they look at each other. Precisely why he has to make his conditions clear before it's too late."
"After several years of unrest, several attempts at containment here and there, he had chosen Munich as his permanent residence early on and lived there in bourgeois respectability, as befits his spirit in certain exceptional cases. The marriage he entered into in his youthful days with a girl from a scholarly family came to an abrupt end shortly after a brief period of happiness. A daughter remained his, while he had never possessed a son."
"The newcomer did not content himself with simply thanking the proximity and beauty of the day and its fortune; he pursued it, questioned it. For example, on Sundays the Poles never appeared on the beach; he learned that they attended mass in San Marco, so he rushed there. Entering the golden twilight through the throng of the square, he found his object, kneeling at the communion rail during the service. Then he stood in the background, amidst the fragmented mosaic floor, among the kneeling, murmuring, cross-waving crowd, and the oppressive splendor of the morning temple filled his senses. In front, the heavily adorned priest wandered, officiating, incense rising, enveloping the impotent flames of the ancient candles, and within the sweet scent of sacrifice, a faint other scent seemed to blend: the smell of the sickly city. But through haze and dampness, Aschenbach saw the beauty turning his head, searching for him, and he saw him."
"He often lay there for the whole long nights, sleeping not a moment, only occasionally staring for hours at the leather. Or he did not hesitate to take great effort to push a chair up to the window, climb over the windowsill, and lean against the window, seemingly in some memory of the enjoyment that once existed for him in looking out the window. For actually, day by day he saw things becoming increasingly indistinct; the hospital across the street, which he had previously cursed with every common occurrence, he could no longer see at all, and if he had not known exactly where he lived, he would have believed he could see nothing but a wasteland from his window, where the gray sky and gray earth were indistinguishable. Only twice had the observant sister seen the chair by the window. Every time she had tidied up the room, she had put the chair back exactly at the window, even leaving the inner windowpane open."
"He was already so far gone, that he could barely maintain his balance even with a stronger sway, and soon he had to make a final decision, for in five minutes it would be a quarter to eight – when the doorbell rang. ""That's someone from the shop,"" he thought, and froze almost completely as his legs danced erratically. A moment remained entirely still. ""Don't open it,"" Gregor thought, clinging to some absurd hope. But then, as always, the maid came steadily towards the door and opened it. Gregor only had to hear the first greeting of the visitor and he already knew who it was – the procurator himself. Why was Gregor condemned to work at a company where the smallest lapse was met with the greatest suspicion? Was did all the employees, with and without exception, amount to, was there not one loyal soul amongst them, whom, even if he had merely squandered a few morning hours, the conscience would have chided and made it impossible for him to leave his bed? Was was it really enough to inquire about an apprentice – if indeed such an inquiry was necessary – and did the procurator have to come himself, thereby showing the entire innocent family that the investigation into this suspicious matter could only be entrusted to the procurator's intellect? And more so with the stir in which Gregor was stirred by these considerations than by the decision itself, he pushed himself with all his might out of bed. There was a loud thud, but it was not really a scream. A little bit of the case was dampened by the rug, and his back was more elastic than Gregor had thought, so it didn't make such a disturbing dull thud. Only his head he hadn't held cautiously enough and bashed it against the rug; he spun it and rubbed it against the rug in annoyance and pain."
"You know, she knows that one lays the napkin over the knee before eating begins, that one wets one's mouth before drinking, that one sets the soup bowl away from oneself and not towards it, that one does not rest one's elbows on the table and does not cut potatoes with a knife. Against all anxieties, all hopes, all that one cannot foresee and does not want to foresee, it helps that one knows that knife and fork should be placed side by side when one is finished eating, with the handle on the right side of the plate. In the face of this man, who at this evening meal confronts her as a tremendous blessing, misfortune, and question, she understood: Now the life has begun, for which all the rest has only been preparation.        He thinks, she looks beautiful even while chewing."
"In his present condition, quite useless thoughts swirled through his head as he stood upright by the door and strained. Sometimes he could no longer bear the overwhelming dullness and would knock his head stupidly against the door, only to grip it back immediately, for even the slight noise he made had been noticed and silenced by everyone. ""What he's up to again,"" the father said after a while, apparently looking towards the door, and only then did the interrupted conversation gradually resume."
"Tadzio, with three or four companions who had stayed with him, moved to the right of the cabin. With a blanket over his knees, resting in the middle between the sea and the row of beach huts in his armchair, Aschenbach still observed him once more. The game, unsupervised, for the women were busy with travel arrangements, seemed haphazard and lacked coherence, and resembled a brawl. The stocky fellow, in a waistcoat and with black, pompadoured hair, who was called ""Jaschu,"" was provoked by a sand throw in the face and went blind, forced Tadzio to fight. The fight, which ended with the weaker one being defeated, was characterized by the vanquished one's desperate desire for revenge, which even after the victory did not cause the victor to distance himself from the vanquished, but rather confirmed his position by kneeling on his back, with his face buried in the sand, causing Tadzio to almost suffocate. His attempts to shake off the burden were spasmodic and ineffective, repeatedly manifesting only as slight tremors. Rescue came as Aschenbach rushed in, and the violent one finally released his victim. Tadzio, pale, slowly raised himself and sat, supported on an arm, for several minutes, with dishevelled hair and darkening eyes. He then stood up completely and slowly walked away. People called after him, initially cheerfully, then imploringly and desperately, but he did not respond. The black one, who had recognized regret for his outburst, fetched him and attempted to apologize. A shrug of the shoulder indicated his rejection. Tadzio walked away diagonally towards the water. He was barefoot and wearing his stained linen suit with a red sash."
"And now he plays for them an impromptu in A major by Franz Schubert, and Bach's Chromatic Fantasy, the Partita in e-minor and the third movement of Mozart's B-flat Piano Concerto. Sometimes he nods along to the rhythm, sometimes he whispers: ""That's it, or?"" Sometimes she whispers: ""That's beautiful."" Sometimes she asks: ""Who's playing?"" Then he replies: Artur Rubinstein, Glenn Gould, Clara Haskil. Between Bach and Mozart, she had gone to the bathroom and hung her son's corduroy trousers on the line. And in front of the mirror stood the perfume bottle, whose scent fills the apartment so well, Chanel No 5. And three toothbrushes in a glass. And on a stool, the woman's nightgown, carelessly thrown on in everyday life. Come on, dear May, and make the trees green again, the piano wishes it could end, but it's already July, the summer evening has become a summer night, the red wine bottle is empty. Are you hungry? Yes. Then let's go eat something. Yes."
"And now?        Without either of them losing a word, they turn their steps homeward. Homeward now also also means going back to his house.        From below, they gaze upward toward the windows that are still brightly illuminated."
"They stubbornly clung to their decision despite the mother's insecurity, which in this room seemed to waver under the commotion. Soon, the mother faded into the background, and the sister helped her move the box out. While Gregor could still wrest the box away in an emergency, the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the women left the room, breathing heavily under the oppressive weight of the box, when Gregor cautiously emerged from under the canopy to contemplate how he could intervene with as little harm as possible. But unfortunately, it was the mother who returned first, while Greta held the box tightly in the next room, carrying it back and forth without disturbing its position. The mother, however, was unfamiliar with Gregor's gaze; a glance that could have made her ill. So Gregor gasped and fled backwards as far as he could, but it was too late. The linen in front moved slightly, enough to alert the mother. She paused, stood still for a moment, and then went back to Greta."
"And if Gregor, despite his wound, had probably lost his mobility forever and needed a long, long time to traverse his room like an old invalid - thoughts of crawling were out of the question - he found a sufficient compensation for this deterioration of his condition simply because, every evening, the armchair door which he had watched closely for an hour or two beforehand, was opened. So he could now, lying in the darkness of his room, unseen from the armchair, see the whole family at the lit table and listen to their voices, somewhat with general permission, that is to say, quite differently than before."
"""Our star,"" he said, ""must not enter the Earth's atmosphere, or it will instantly burn up. So the star remains in the heavens, securely fastened to the firmament with a safety pin, like the photographs on my bookshelves. You sigh. You say yes. He knows, he makes it difficult for you to say yes. An immortal sacrifice, the song whispers in his ear. Who is allowed to bring this sacrifice is a matter of selection."""
"Perhaps he simply went out with her to be able to come back. To have the illusion that there could also be an ordinary life for her, which is so familiar to him. Of course, she had already gone into the living room. While he went to get a second bottle of wine from the kitchen. When he comes in, she's standing by the window. The windowsill is so low that it wouldn't be a work of art to climb out, she thinks. Over there, she says, someone's still awake. He says, ""He's a good friend of ours, who paints."" She probably heard him say ""from us."" He wants her to know what she's up to. She turns to him. He holds a record in his hand, a cigarette hangs loosely between his lips. Take your pipe away, you dog. Here's the Requiem. It doesn't really fit now, she says. Now, she's said it. The dead don't sleep in the earth, but wait. Good music always fits, he says and puts the cigarette down. Well then, she says. He pulls out the platter from its sleeve and slowly pushes it over the grooves before placing it."
"When the cleaning lady arrives, Katharina moves her things onto the sofa. When the room is clean, she puts them back on the floor. If she has to put away the books, she pushes them aside. There is no space for two large boxes in her bookcase. The basement was just flooded. Should she simply throw them away as they are? She opens the top box and takes a look inside. Then she closes it again."
"""How beautiful the fish's ridges are,"" he says, glancing at the ribcage, which evokes a leg bone house, but also the great hall in the Natural History Museum, where the giant dinosaur skeleton is on display.        ""When I was a child, my grandfather taught me to fish,"" she says.        For a moment he saw him sitting on a log with his knees bent and holding a fishing rod in the water. What power such a pose holds, he thought. It sends an image into your head, whether you want it or not."
"We'll only see each other now and then, he said, but every time it should be like the first time – a celebration. You listen attentively and nod. “It can only be your luxury,” he said, “because I’m a married man. I know, you might not be enough for me, you said.” She glared at him, her pupils dilated in a golden ring. I have not only a wife but also a relationship with a woman on the radio, she continued. And if you had a thousand women, she went on, what’s important is the time we spend together. How can you ever make her something of value if she doesn’t ask for it? The dark scarf she wears, like a boarding school student, tugs at him endlessly. If he doesn’t speak what he wants to say quickly, it will be too late. And we mustn’t reveal ourselves to each other – you and I both know, that’s enough. It’s okay, she said and chuckled. Where conditions are negotiated, that’s about something that remains. She had been afraid yesterday and today all day that he would kick her out of his life once again."
"Will you come to my funeral?   She looks down at the coffee cup in front of her and says nothing.   Will you come to my funeral, he asks once more.   She says, you're still very much alive.   But he asks a third time: Will you come to my funeral?   Yes, she says, of course I will come to your funeral.   A birch tree stands next to the place I have chosen.   Beautiful, she says.   Four months later, she is in Pittsburgh when she receives the news that he has died.   It's her birthday, but before the first congratulations arrive from Europe, Ludwig calls her, her son, and says: Your father died today.   On her birthday.   When his funeral takes place, she is still in Pittsburgh."
"While he now brings the wine from the kitchen, she takes a few steps into the room and looks around. Small figures and toy soldiers stand before the books, postcards were leaned against the book covers, photos pinned to the boards: a little boy, apparently the son, sitting on a pony, an empty landscape with clouds, a beautiful woman on a Hollywood swing, probably his wife, she's laughing at the photographer, who maybe was him, Hans, but who now laughs at everyone who sees the picture, including her, the visitor. He's now clinking the glasses, he holds both in one hand, the bottle in the other, shall we listen to some music? he asks and goes over to the living room. Yes, she says and follows."
"For the second time and finally, it had been proven that this city was incredibly detrimental to him under these weather conditions. Selfish persistence seemed irrational, with the prospects of a wind change entirely uncertain. It was a matter of swift decisions. To return home now, even if it meant abandoning summer or winter quarters, was out of the question. Not only here were there sea and sand, elsewhere they existed without the malicious mixture of lagoon and fever. He recalled a small seaside resort not far from Trieste, which they had praised him for. Why not there? And even without delay, so that the occasional change of location might still be worthwhile. He made up his mind and set off. At the next gondola landing stage, he hired a boat and allowed himself to be guided through the murky labyrinth of canals, flanked by carved marble balls, past glittering wall corners, past mourning palace facades that reflected the flickering company logos in the murky water, towards St. Mark's. It was difficult for him to reach his destination, for the gondolier, armed with warehouses and glassblowing workshops, tried to force him to visit and make purchases at every turn. And when the bizarre journey through Venice began to reveal its magic, the cunning business spirit of the sunken queen restored its meaning, leaving him disillusioned."
"There is no path back, neither to the wolf nor the child. At the beginning of things it is not innocence and simplicity; all creation, even the seemingly simplest, is already guilty, already complex, already entangled in the muddy current of becoming and can never again swim upstream. The path to innocence, to the uncreated, to God lies not in returning, but in going forward, not to the wolf or the child, but ever deeper into the guilt, ever further into the humanization. Even with suicide too, you, poor steppe wolf, will not be taken seriously, you will already walk the longer, more arduous and heavier path of humanization, you will have to multiply your unity many times over, complicate your complexity much further. Instead of narrowing your world, simplifying your soul, you will always embrace more and more of the world, finally taking all of the world into your achingly expanded soul in order to perhaps reach the end, the peace. This path is Buddha, this path has been walked by every great man, whether knowingly or unknowingly, as fate permitted. Every birth means separation from the whole, means limitation, isolation from God, painful rebirth. Returning to the whole, annulling the painful individuation, Godhood means: to have expanded your soul so that it can encompass the whole again."
"""The figures into which you have projected your alleged personality have crumbled before me. Without figures, I cannot play."" He held up a mirror, and once more I saw my unity of person fragmenting into many I's, the number seemed to be increasing. But the figures were now very small, about the size of tabletop chess pieces, and the player, with silent, cautious fingers, picked up a dozen or so and placed them beside the chessboard on the floor. He spoke in a monotone, like a man who was repeating a familiar speech or lecture."""
"You are but a small boy. And just as you were too comfortable to learn to dance when it was almost too late, so were you also too comfortable to learn to love. Ideal and tragic love, oh friend, you can certainly enjoy it, I have no doubt, but all respect before it! Now you will learn to love in an ordinary and human way too. The beginning is already made, you can go to a ball soon. Well, you still have to learn the waltz to start tomorrow. I'll be there at three. How did the music strike you here?"
"It is a joy for me, dear Harry, to be able to spend some time with you today. You have often been burdened by your life, yearning to escape from here, don't you? You long to leave behind this time, this world, this reality and enter another, one that resonates with you, a world without time. Do so, my dear friend, I urge you. You know where that other world lies, it is the world of your own soul that you seek. It is only within your own inner self that that other reality resides, the one you yearn for. I can give you nothing that does not already exist within you, I cannot open any gallery of images other than the one of your soul. I can give you nothing, but the opportunity, the impetus, the key. I will help you make your own world visible, that is all."
"""Did you understand a word of it?"" the procurator asked the parents, ""he's making a fool of us."" ""For God's sake,"" the mother sobbed, ""he might be seriously sick, and we're tormenting him. Greta! Greta!"" she cried. The sister from the other side called out, ""You must go to the doctor immediately. Gregor is sick. Hurry, get the doctor. Have you heard from Gregor?""   ""That was a beastly whisper,"" the procurator said, surprisingly soft compared to the mother's cries. ""Anna! Anna!"" the father shouted through the front room into the kitchen, ""fetch a locksmith right away!"" And already the two girls were rushing out of the front room – how had the sister dressed so quickly? – and burst open the apartment door. One didn't even hear the door close; they must have left it open, as is usual in homes where great misfortune has occurred."
"""Dear parents,"" said the sister, tapping the table with her hand, ""it can't go on like this. If you don't understand, I see it. I won't utter my brother's name in the presence of such a beast. Therefore, I simply say: we must get rid of it. We have already exhausted every possible means of care and tolerance, and I believe no one can blame us for doing so."""
